# üîç RECONCILIATION PLAN REVIEW
**Critical Analysis of UX Plan vs Core Principles**
**Date: February 9, 2025**
**Reviewers: Tech Team UX Expert + Dr. Elena Mortgage Expert**

---

## üìå CORE PRINCIPLES ASSESSMENT

### **Core Principle Violations Identified**

#### 1. ‚ùå **"Less is More" - VIOLATED**
**Current State**: Step 2 for refinancing has 8-10 fields/interactions
**Violation Details**:
- Property type ‚Üí Rate type selector ‚Üí Current rate ‚Üí Floating spread (conditional) ‚Üí Thereafter rate (conditional) ‚Üí Outstanding loan ‚Üí Age slider ‚Üí Current bank ‚Üí Tenure extension question ‚Üí Years owned (conditional) ‚Üí Lock-in status
- **This is NOT minimal** - users face a complex decision tree

**Dr. Elena's Concern**: "The tenure extension calculation requires IWAA age, but you're using average age. This creates inaccurate expectations that brokers must correct later."

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ AGREED**
- REMOVE rate type selector and floating spread fields entirely ‚Üí Move to broker
- REMOVE age slider if no tenure extension needed ‚Üí Broker handles later
- Simplified Step 2 will have only 4 core fields for refinancing 

#### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Show Value Fast" - PARTIALLY VIOLATED**
**Current State**: Instant calc triggers after 4-6 fields
**Issues**:
- New Purchase: Must complete 4 fields + see assumptions box before value
- Refinancing: Must complete 5+ fields including tenure decision
- **45 seconds target is unrealistic** with current flow

**UX Expert Note**: "Progressive disclosure at micro-level (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) creates cognitive load. Users don't know how many more fields are coming."

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENT 3-BRANCH LIMIT**
- Enforce maximum 3 conditional branches per step
- Any field group with >3 conditionals must be split or simplified
- This will be a hard rule for implementation

#### 3. ‚úÖ **"Broker Handoff" - ALIGNED**
But with issues in execution (see Field Complexity section)

#### 4. ‚ùå **"Mobile-First" - QUESTIONABLE**
**Issues Identified**:
- Visual property cards (2x2 grid) problematic on small screens
- Age slider difficult for precise selection on mobile
- Multiple conditional fields create scrolling fatigue
- No mention of mobile-specific input types

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ MOBILE-FIRST FIXES**
- Property cards: Change to single column vertical list on all screens
- Age input: Replace slider with number input + increment/decrement buttons
- Conditional fields: Max 3 branches to minimize scrolling
- Touch targets: Ensure minimum 48x48px for all interactive elements

#### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Trust Building" - OVER-COMPLICATED**
**Current State**: Too many assumptions and disclaimers
**Issues**:
- Hidden assumptions box adds complexity
- Multiple conditional insights dilute trust signals
- Generic rates (2.6-3.2%) may seem misleading

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ TRUST BUILDING APPROACH**
**New Purchase:**
- Show assumptions as READ-ONLY disclaimer (not editable)
- Direct users to broker for customization
- Clear message: "These are typical assumptions. Your broker will customize based on your situation."

**Refinancing:**
- Show informational assumptions clearly
- Simplify for users without financial commitments

**LLM Bank Insights Integration (Phase 2):**
- Once database ready, show "Lowest rate available: X%" to create urgency
- Use real market data instead of generic 2.6-3.2% range
- This will solve the misleading rates issue and build trust

## üö® FIELD & FLOW ISSUES

### **STEP 2: NEW PURCHASE PATH**

#### **Field Structure Problems**:

1. **Property Category Cards**
   - **Issue**: Visual cards nice for desktop, but 2x2 grid problematic on mobile
   - **Better**: Single column with clear tap targets
   - **Code Bloat**: Implementing custom card UI vs simple radio buttons

2. **Combined Age Slider**
   - **Dr. Elena Flag**: "Average age for IWAA is fundamentally incorrect. For a $800k loan, the difference between average age (35) and proper IWAA (weighted by $100k/$50k income split) could be 3-5 years, affecting tenure by that amount."
   - **UX Issue**: Sliders are imprecise on mobile
   - **Better**: Number input with +/- buttons

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ NEW PURCHASE AGE STRATEGY**
**Step 2 Approach:**
- Use APPROXIMATE age with CLEAR DISCLAIMER
- Display: "‚ö†Ô∏è This is an approximate calculation. We'll get precise figures in the next step."
- Show tentative max loan eligibility based on this approximation
- This provides instant value while setting expectations

**Step 3 Refinement:**
- Collect actual ages and incomes for both applicants
- Calculate proper IWAA for accurate results
- Message: "Now let's get your precise eligibility based on actual ages and incomes"

**Why This Works:**
- Users get instant gratification in Step 2 (approximate value)
- Clear disclaimer prevents false expectations
- Step 3 provides accuracy without duplicating the full form
- Progressive refinement feels natural

3. **Purchase Timeline in Step 2**
   - **Contradiction**: Your note says it should be 4th field, but timeline doesn't affect calculations
   - **Better**: Move to Step 3 or make optional

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ REMOVE FROM FORM**
- Purchase timeline removed from Step 2 entirely
- Broker will determine urgency during consultation
- This reduces Step 2 to truly essential fields only

4. **Hidden Assumptions Box**
   - **UX Anti-pattern**: Hidden critical information
   - **User Confusion**: "Why are my calculations changing?"
   - **Better**: Show assumptions inline with clear defaults

### **STEP 2: REFINANCING PATH**

#### **Major Complexity Issues**:

1. **Rate Type Selector (Fixed/Floating/Hybrid)**
   - **Good intent**, but creates branches:
     - Floating ‚Üí Spread input
     - Fixed < 2.5% ‚Üí Thereafter rate
   - **Each branch = cognitive load**

   NOTE:
   2.5% should be drawn from the lowest rate in live bank packagae database as per @LLM_BANK_INSIGHTS_ARCHITECTURE.md, not fixed in 2.5%.

2. **Tenure Extension Question**
   - **Critical Decision Point** that triggers different fields
   - **Dr. Elena**: "Formula requires years owned OR remaining tenure, but you're asking both conditionally. This creates data inconsistency."
   - **Better**: Ask years owned for everyone (needed for calculation anyway)

3. **Lock-in Status AFTER Instant Calc**
   - **Logic Issue**: Lock-in affects refinancing eligibility
   - **Should be BEFORE calculation** to set proper expectations

4. **Current Bank "Required but Optional"**
   - **Contradiction**: Can't be both required and have "prefer not to say"
   - **Data Quality**: "Prefer not to say" prevents bank exclusion in recommendations

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ CURRENT BANK HANDLING**
- Make it a required field with "Prefer not to say" as an option
- This allows data collection while respecting privacy
- "Prefer not to say" users can be flagged for special broker attention
- Helps filter potentially difficult conversions

### **STEP 3: DIFFERENTIATED APPROACH**

#### **New Purchase Issues**:

1. **Actual Ages Collection**
   - **Good**: Corrects IWAA calculation
   - **Bad**: Why not collect upfront in Step 1?
   - **User Frustration**: "Why ask age twice?"

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ PROGRESSIVE AGE COLLECTION**
- Keep Step 1 lean with 4 fields only
- Step 2: Approximate age for instant insights
- Step 3: Actual ages for precise IWAA calculation
- This maintains progressive disclosure and avoids overwhelming users upfront

2. **Credit Card Count Dropdown**
   - **Dr. Elena**: "Banks care about credit limit, not card count. 6 cards with $1k limit each is different from 2 cards with $10k limit each."
   - **Better**: Ask for total credit limit

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ SIMPLIFIED CREDIT CARD APPROACH**
- Use credit card COUNT only (not limits)
- Apply standard assumption: $50/month per card for TDSR
- Example: 2 cards = $100/month in commitments
- Broker collects actual statements later for precise calculations
- This keeps form simple while providing useful approximation

3. **Employment Status Complexity**
   - Good categories but missing contractor/gig economy
   - Conditional messages add complexity

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES**
- Keep 3 simple options: Employed / Self-Employed / Recently Changed
- Contractors/gig workers select "Self-Employed"
- Remove conditional messages to reduce complexity

#### **Refinancing Issues**:

1. **Income/Job Changes Since Loan**
   - **Too Vague**: "Changes" could mean anything
   - **Better**: Specific options (increased >20%, decreased >20%, stable)

**RESOLUTION: ‚úÖ KEEP VAGUE INTENTIONALLY**
- Keep income/job changes question vague and open-ended
- Too many permutations to capture specifically
- Broker will probe for details during consultation
- Just need to flag: "Has there been a change?" Yes/No
- If yes, capture if now self-employed

2. **Package Preferences**
   - **Good UI** (button grid)
   - **Issue**: Multiple selection not clear
   - **Missing**: Priority ranking

## üíª TECHNICAL DEBT & CODE ISSUES

### **State Management Chaos**:

1. **Progressive Field Groups (2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3...)**
   ```typescript
   // This creates complex state tracking
   if (!formState.propertyCategory) return 2;
   if (!formState.combinedAge) return 2.1;
   if (!formState.purchaseTimeline) return 2.2;
   ```
   - **Issue**: Micro-state management is fragile
   - **Better**: Show field groups together

2. **Redundant State** (from original plan notes):
   - Still have `fieldValues` AND `watch` from React Hook Form
   - `propertyCategory` as separate state
   - **This wasn't cleaned up as planned**

3. **Instant Calculation Triggers**:
   - One-time calculation goal conflicts with LTV toggle
   - If user changes assumptions, no recalc?
   - **User expects interactivity**

### **Validation Schema Misalignment**:

1. **Schema doesn't match new fields**:
   - Missing: rateType, thereafterRate, tenureExtension, yearsOwned
   - Missing: actualAges (array), creditCards (count)
   - Missing: incomeChanges, packagePreference

2. **Optional vs Required Confusion**:
   - Current bank: required with optional value?
   - Years owned: conditional requirement
   - Complex conditional validation needed

---

## üìä DR. ELENA'S MORTGAGE ACCURACY FLAGS

### **Critical Calculation Issues**:

1. **IWAA Age Misuse**:
   - Using average age for calculations is **fundamentally wrong**
   - Proper IWAA formula: `(Age1 √ó Income1 + Age2 √ó Income2) / (Income1 + Income2)`
   - Impact: 3-5 year tenure difference typical

2. **LTV Assumptions**:
   - 75% default ignores CPF/cash availability
   - No consideration for pledged assets
   - Show fund / pledge fund calculations missing

3. **Tenure Formulas**:
   - Your formula: `min(30 - yearsOwned - 1, 75 - age)`
   - **Missing**: Property purchase date affects calculation
   - **Missing**: Remaining lease for old HDB flats

4. **Interest Rate Placeholders**:
   - Generic 2.6-3.2% range too broad
   - Should vary by property type and loan amount
   - SORA rates change daily - static placeholder misleading

5. **Missing Commitments**:
   - No overdraft facilities consideration
   - Guarantor obligations not captured
   - Business loans for self-employed missing

## üé® UX EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Simplification Opportunities**:

1. **Combine Related Fields**:
   - Merge rate type and rate into single component
   - Combine age inputs (just ask both ages upfront)
   - Merge tenure preference with years owned

2. **Remove Conditional Complexity**:
   - Always show tenure extension option (not conditional)
   - Always ask years owned (needed anyway)
   - Show all assumptions upfront

3. **Progressive Disclosure That Works**:
   ```
   Step 2A: Property basics (3 fields max)
   Step 2B: Financial parameters (3 fields max)
   Step 2C: See results ‚Üí Adjust if needed
   ```

4. **Mobile Optimizations Needed**:
   - Single column layouts
   - Number inputs with steppers (not sliders)
   - Larger touch targets (min 48x48px)
   - Sticky progress indicator

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### **MUST FIX**:

1. **IWAA Age Calculation**
   - Collect both ages upfront (Step 1 or early Step 2)
   - Calculate proper IWAA, not average
   - Show both ages in assumptions

2. **Simplify Step 2 Refinancing**
   - Reduce to 5 core fields max
   - Move complex decisions to Step 3
   - One-time calculation with clear assumptions

3. **Fix State Management**
   - Remove redundant state tracking
   - Simplify progressive disclosure
   - Clear single source of truth

4. **Mobile-First Redesign**
   - Vertical layouts only
   - Touch-friendly inputs
   - Reduce scrolling requirements

5. **Clear Data Requirements**
   - Define required vs optional clearly
   - Remove "required but optional" contradictions
   - Align validation schemas

### **CONSIDER DROPPING**:

1. Micro-progressive disclosure (2.1, 2.2, etc.)
2. Hidden assumptions box
3. Conditional thereafter rate prompt
4. Visual property cards (use simple list)
5. Combined age slider (use number inputs)

## üîÑ ADHERENCE TO ORIGINAL PLAN

### **What Got Lost**:

1. **Original Goal**: 3-4 fields per step
   - **Reality**: 8-10 fields/decisions in Step 2

2. **Original Goal**: Instant value in 30 seconds
   - **Reality**: 2-3 minutes with current flow

3. **Original Goal**: Simple progressive disclosure
   - **Reality**: Complex micro-states and conditions

4. **Original Goal**: Defer complexity to broker
   - **Reality**: Still asking complex questions upfront
