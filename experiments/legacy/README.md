# Experiments / Legacy

Prototype components kept for reference only. These files are not loaded in production builds—use them as historical context when reviving legacy flows.

- `components/forms/CommercialQuickForm.tsx`
- `components/forms/LoanTypeSelector.tsx`

If a legacy component graduates back into the app, move it to `components/` or `app/` and delete the copy here.
