Singapore Property Purchase Timelines and EHG Grants
12 sources
The collected sources offer a comprehensive guide to property transactions and associated financial and regulatory matters, primarily within Singapore. One source, "Advance Mortgage Program.pdf," covers a broad spectrum of topics, including mortgage agreements, strata titles, urban planning (Master and Concept Plans), conservation rules, collective sales (En-bloc), and detailed timelines for HDB and private property transactions as well as CPF usage rules and housing grants (EHG). The remaining sources provide official contract templates for specific property dealings, with "Annex A - OTP - Private.pdf" detailing the Option to Purchase for private residential property, "Annex B - OTP - HDB.pdf" providing the prescribed Option to Purchase for HDB resale flats, and "Annex C - Tenancy Agreement.pdf" presenting a template for private residential tenancy agreements. Finally, "Annex D - MAS 632A Factsheet.pdf" illustrates a loan factsheet for housing loans, outlining interest rates, fees, and repayment details, while "Annex F - EHG Grant.pdf" specifically tables the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) structure based on household income.

Can I have the all in all detailed knowledge database of ALL sources that are inputted that can be used as factual sources and precise calculations in Singapore mortgage. It should be a single source of truth, an encylopedia that can be used as a textbook.

This encyclopaedic reference serves as a detailed knowledge database for key concepts, regulations, processes, and precise calculations governing Singapore mortgages, drawing exclusively from the provided sources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Mortgage Fundamentals and Legal Framework
A mortgage is defined as a legal agreement between a creditor (Mortgagee), usually a financial institution, and a borrower (Mortgagor). The Mortgagee lends money at interest to the Mortgagor. In exchange, the Mortgagor surrenders the title deed to the Mortgagee as collateral against the loan. Upon completion of full repayment, the Mortgagee releases the title deed to the Mortgagor.
A. Mortgage Terms and Documents
The terms of a mortgage typically include:
• A written agreement.
• The property pledged as collateral.
• A legal description of the property.
• Valid evidence of the debt.
• A statement of parties in the contract.
• The agreement must be signed by both the Mortgagor and the Mortgagee.
Mortgage In Escrow (MIE) is a mortgage signed in advance by the borrower against borrowing before the property title is issued. This applies to Building Under Construction (BUC) properties where caveats are permitted to be lodged on MIE prior to transferring into title once issued.
B. Mortgagee Rights in Default
In the event of a default, the Mortgagee is allowed various rights, including:
• The Right of foreclosure and therefore ownership of the property.
• The ability to grant a lease.
• The power to appoint a receiver to the rental proceeds.
• The power to sell the property without a court order via public auction or private treaty.
C. Undesirable Properties for Financing
Banks generally do not finance properties they cannot accept as collateral, such as:
• Properties where the lease is less than 30 years when the loan matures.
• Gifted properties.
• Transactions with unfair preferences (e.g., selling under valuation).
• Properties with special purposes (e.g., religious).
• Properties used for immoral purposes or those within red light districts (e.g., even numbered Lorong 2-36 Geylang, Desker Road, Keong Saik Road, Sam Leong Road).
D. Caveats
A caveat is a notice of interest on a property. It can be lodged in the following scenarios:
• An approved mortgage by a bank to an owner.
• CPF funds released to purchase residential property by CPF Board.
• A buyer who has exercised an option to purchase and paid the deposit on a property.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Property Ownership, Planning, and Sales Processes
A. Manner of Holding
Property ownership in Singapore can be held in two ways:
Holding Type
Ownership
Succession
Recommended Use
Tenancy-in-Common
Each owner holds a specified, unequal share (e.g., 99%/1%).
Follows testate/intestate succession rules.
Friends/family members with intended unequal shares.
Joint Tenancy
Undivided joint interest.
Passes to the surviving owner.
Common for spouses.
B. Fractional Purchases (Decoupling)
A fractional purchase is a transaction where an existing owner (A) sells their share of the property to another existing owner (B) (e.g., Joint Tenancy or Tenancy in Common 50/50 or 99/1). Alternatively, an existing owner sells a certain percentage of share to another person, forming a Co-Ownership based on Tenancy in Common (e.g., 99/1).
Key aspects of a fractional purchase (decoupling) for the buyer (B):
• Buyer (B) forms up the purchase price using Cash / CPF / Loan.
• Buyer (B) restructures their existing share of the loan.
• Buyer (B) pays for Buyer Stamp Duty (BSD) on the share of property purchased.
• In the case of forming co-ownership (e.g., 99/1), the new co-owner (B) owning 1% is now able to use CPF Ordinary Account funds for instalments and their income can be recognised for Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) calculation.
C. Divorce and Property Division
In the event of a divorce, the Court may order the division of matrimonial property in the following ways:
• A Sale in the Open Market.
• A Sale from one party to the other (which proceeds as a Fractional Purchase).
• A Transfer from one party to the other without Cash & CPF Consideration (which proceeds as Refinancing).
• A Transfer from one party to the other with CPF consideration only (which proceeds as Refinancing, including CPF refund, with LTV Capped at 75%).
• A Transfer from one party to the other with both Cash & CPF Consideration (which proceeds as Refinancing, including CPF refund with LTV Capped at 75%, but no financing is allowed for cash considerations).
D. Planning and Conservation
• Concept Plan: Guides Singapore’s development over 50 years, first developed in 1971, reviewed every 10 years, and maps out long-term plans for transportation and strategic land usage.
• Master Plan: Instrumental in guiding Singapore’s physical development, first published in 1958, reviewed every 5 years, and is a statutory plan showing land use and development (e.g., Residential, Commercial). The Master Plan translates the Concept Plan vision into detailed implementation plans.
• Plot Ratio and Building Height: Residential developments generally have a Gross Plot Ratio / Storey Height Control Limit. For instance, a Gross Plot Ratio of 1.4 corresponds to 5 storeys, while a GPR of >2.8 corresponds to >36 stories.
• Conservation: Retention of old buildings with more lenient rules than preservation. Conservation status means the building cannot be demolished, and original structural/architectural properties must be retained. Envelop control allows a building to be demolished and rebuilt, but it must adhere to specific conditions like design, height, and roof form.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Contracts, Transactions, and Timelines
A. Option to Purchase (OTP)
The OTP grants exclusive rights to the buyer for an agreed defined period in exchange for an option fee.
• It is the Buyer’s right to buy, but they are not a must to buy and will forfeit the option fee if they choose not to exercise.
• Once granted by the seller, it is a must to sell obligation for the seller.
• If the OTP is assigned or transferred, the new holder enjoys the same rights.
Property Type
Option Fee

$4,000 (Option Fee + Exercise Fee $\leq $5,000$)
$5,000 Deposit (Max)
21 calendar days
Note: The amounts and periods above for both private and HDB properties are market practice but can be negotiated (HDB negotiable with conditions). HDB resale transactions must use the HDB prescribed OTP form, and no amendments may be made to the prescribed form.
B. Sales & Purchase (S&P) and Tenancy
• Sales & Purchase Agreement: A comprehensive, legally binding contract between Seller and Buyer including key information such as Vacant Possession Date, Unit’s Specifications, Payment Schedules, Tenures of Land, Defects Liability Period, and Margins of Error.
• Tenancy Agreement (TA): A legal binding document between landlord & tenant. It must be stamped by IRAS, and the stamp duty is payable by the tenants.
C. Timelines and Payment Schemes
Progressive Payment Scheme (PPS) for BUC
The standard PPS involves scheduled payments tied to construction milestones: | Payment Milestone | Amount Payable | | :--- | :--- | | Grant Option to Purchase | 5% | | Signing of S&P or 8 Weeks from Option | 15% | | Completion of Foundation | 10% | | Reinforcement Concrete | 10% | | Brick Walls | 5% | | Roofing/Ceiling | 5% | | Electrical Wiring | 5% | | Car park, Roads, Drains | 5% | | Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) | 25% | | Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC) | 15% |
Deferred Payment Scheme (DPS) for EC BUC
The DPS is available for New Launch EC only. It frontloads the initial downpayment but defers the bulk of the payment until TOP: | Payment Milestone | Amount Payable | | :--- | :--- | | Grant Option to Purchase | 5% | | Signing of S&P or 9 Weeks from Option | 15% | | Completion of Foundation / RC / Walls / Roofing / Wiring / Car park | Deferred | | Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) | 65% | | Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC) | 15% |
Order of Disbursement
Monies must be paid in a fixed order:
1. Cash.

IV. Central Provident Fund (CPF) Usage and Regulations
A. CPF Schemes and Usage
CPF Ordinary Account (OA) savings can be used for:
• Paying for the property partially or in full.
• Payment of Buyer Stamp Duty (BSD) / Additional Buyer Stamp Duty (ABSD) (by reimbursement for private residential property).
• Servicing monthly home loan instalments from HDB or Financial Institutions (FIs).
Housing schemes supported by CPF:
• Public Housing Scheme (PHS): For members buying an HDB flat to live in.
• Residential Properties Scheme (RPS): For members buying private residential properties (owner-occupation or investment).
B. CPF Limits
The use of CPF funds is governed by two limits:
1. Valuation Limit (VL): The lower of the property's Valuation or Purchase Price at the time of purchase. This determines the amount of CPF OA allowed to be used at purchase.
2. Withdrawal Limit (WL): Set at 120% of the Valuation Limit. Once the WL is reached, no further withdrawal of CPF funds is allowed, and the outstanding loan must be serviced by cash only.
C. Retirement Sum and Multiple Properties
The CPF Retirement Sum aims to support a 20-year retirement. To purchase more than one property using CPF, members must set aside the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) in a combination of Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA). The excess funds remaining in the OA after setting aside the BRS can then be used for the next property.
D. CPF Refunds and Charges
When a property is sold, the proceeds are used for refunding CPF and outstanding loans. The order depends on the purchase date:
Property Purchase Date
Order of Sale Proceeds Use (Refund)
On or after 1st Sept 2002
1. Refund CPF Principal amount withdrawn. 2. Refund Outstanding Housing Loan. 3. Refund CPF Accrued Interest.
Before 1st Sept 2002
1. Refund Outstanding Housing Loan. 2. Refund CPF Principal amount withdrawn. 3. Refund CPF Accrued Interest.
The CPF Board files a charge on the property upon release of CPF savings in a tiered order:
1. Outstanding housing loan from financier.
2. CPF principal sum up to 100% VL plus CPF withdrawals for legal and stamp fees.
3. Equal ranking (pari passu): CPF principal sum beyond 100% VL plus accrued interest, and repayment of outstanding housing loan interests.
4. Equal ranking (pari passu): CPF legal costs and expenses, and financier’s legal costs and expenses.
5. Cash out Equity/Property Term Loan/Overdraft.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. HDB Specific Rules and Grants
A. HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) and Loans
Buyers intending to obtain an HDB housing loan must have a valid HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) Letter when the sellers grant the Option to Purchase. HDB Loan features include:
• Cash Downpayment: 0%.
• LTV: Up to 75% (w.e.f. 20 Aug 2024).
• Interest: CPF OA + 0.10%.
• Tenure: Typically $\leq 25$ years.
For a second HDB concessionary loan, the loan quantum is reduced by full CPF proceeds, CPF balance, and part of cash proceeds. Homeowners can keep $25,000 or half of cash proceeds, whichever is higher.
B. HDB Housing Grants
Grants are given based on factors such as application frequency and marital status. The amount will be pro-rated if the remaining lease cannot cover the youngest core buyer/occupier up to age 95. Grants cannot be used for the minimum cash down-payment or monthly mortgage instalment payments.
Examples of Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) eligibility:
• First Timer Family (Income $\leq $9,000$): Up to $\mathbf{$120,000}$.
• First Timer Single (Income $\leq $4,500$): Up to $\mathbf{$60,000}$.
Proximity Housing Grants (PHG):

First Subsidised Flat Type
Resale Levy Amount (Households)
4-room
$\mathbf{$40,000}$
5-room
$\mathbf{$45,000}$
Executive Apt /Msn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI. Regulatory Calculations and Financial Limits (MAS & IRAS)
A. Income Recognition (MAS Notice 645)
For Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) and Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) calculations, income is recognised as follows: | Income Type | Recognition Rate | Regulatory Basis | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Monthly Basic Salary | $\mathbf{100%}$ | MAS 645 § 10(a) | | Variable Income (e.g., bonus) | $\mathbf{70%}$ of annual variable income, divided by 12 | MAS 645 § 10(b) | | Rental Income | $\mathbf{70%}$ (if $\geq 6$ months lease remaining) | MAS 645 § 10(c) | | Self-employed Income | $\mathbf{70%}$ of latest NOA (if $\geq 2$ years in business) | MAS 645 § 10(b) |
B. Tenure Limits

IWAA Calculation: $\text{IWAA} = \sum(\text{Age} \times \text{Income}) / \sum(\text{Income})$.
C. Debt Servicing Ratios
Loan affordability is measured using a stress test rate of $\text{MAX}(\text{package rate}, \mathbf{4.00%})$ for residential property.
1. Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR): Applies to HDB and EC developer units.
    ◦ Formula: $\text{MSR} = \text{Potential Mortgage Liability} / \text{Total Income} \leq \mathbf{30%}$.
2. Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR): Applies to all purchases, refinancing, and credit secured by property.
    ◦ Formula: $\text{TDSR} = (\text{Total Monthly Debt Obligations} + \text{Potential Mortgage Liability}) / \text{Total Monthly Income} \leq \mathbf{55%}$.
Total Monthly Debt Obligations include:
• Credit cards: $\text{MAX}(\mathbf{3%} \times \text{Outstanding Balance}, \mathbf{$50})$.
• Other loans (Car, Personal, etc.): Actual instalments.
• Guarantor Exposure: $\mathbf{20%}$ of the guaranteed loan’s monthly instalment.
D. Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Downpayments
LTV is calculated based on the purchase price or valuation, whichever is lower.
Scenario
LTV Limit
Minimum Cash Downpayment
Standard Purchase
$\mathbf{75%}$
$\mathbf{5%}$ cash
Extended Purchase
$\mathbf{55%}$
$\mathbf{10%}$ cash
E. Buyer's Stamp Duty (BSD) and ABSD (IRAS 2025 Rates)
Stamp duties are calculated on the purchase price or valuation, whichever is higher.
Buyer’s Stamp Duty (BSD) Tiers: | Bracket | Rate | Incremental Tax | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | 1st $180,000 | 1% | $1,800 | | Next $180,000 | 2% | $3,600 | | Next $640,000 | 3% | $19,200 | | Next $500,000 | 4% | $20,000 | | Next $1.5 million | 5% | $75,000 | | Above $3 million | 6% | Balance $\times 6%$ |
Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) Rates: | Profile | 1st Property | 2nd Property | 3rd+ Property | Entities | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Singapore Citizen | 0% | 20% | 30% | N/A | | Permanent Resident | 5% | 30% | 35% | N/A | | Foreigners | 60% | N/A | N/A | N/A | | Entities | N/A | N/A | N/A | 65% |
F. Equity Loans (Cash-Out)

The following is a comprehensive knowledge database, formatted in Markdown text, detailing key facts, regulations, processes, and precise calculations governing Singapore mortgages, drawing exclusively from the provided sources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singapore Mortgage and Property Encyclopaedia
I. Mortgage Fundamentals and Legal Framework
A mortgage is defined as a legal agreement between a creditor (Mortgagee), usually a financial institution, and a borrower (Mortgagor). The Mortgagee lends money at interest to the Mortgagor. In exchange, the Mortgagor surrenders the title deed to the Mortgagee as collateral against the loan. Upon completion of full repayment, the Mortgagee releases the title deed to the Mortgagor.
A. Mortgage Terms and Documents
The terms of a mortgage typically include:
• A written agreement.
• The property pledged as collateral.
• A legal description of the property.
• Valid evidence of the debt.
• A statement of parties in the contract.
• The agreement must be signed by both the Mortgagor and the Mortgagee.
Mortgage In Escrow (MIE) is a mortgage signed in advance by the borrower against borrowing before the property title is issued. This applies to Building Under Construction (BUC) properties where caveats are permitted to be lodged on MIE prior to transferring into title once issued.
B. Mortgagee Rights in Default
In the event of a default, the Mortgagee is allowed various rights, such as:
• The Right of foreclosure and therefore ownership of the property.
• The ability to grant a lease.
• The power to appoint a receiver to the rental proceeds.
• The power to sell the property without a court order via public auction or private treaty.
C. Undesirable Properties for Financing
Banks generally do not finance properties they cannot accept as collateral, including:
• Properties where the lease is less than 30 years when the loan matures.
• Gifted properties.
• Transactions with unfair preferences (e.g., selling under valuation).
• Properties with special purposes (e.g., religious).
• Properties used for immoral purposes or those within red light districts (e.g., even numbered Lorong 2-36 Geylang, Desker Road, Keong Saik Road, Sam Leong Road).
D. Caveats
A caveat is a notice of interest on a property. It can be lodged in the following scenarios:
• An approved mortgage by a bank to an owner.
• CPF funds released to purchase residential property by CPF Board.
• A buyer who has exercised an option to purchase and paid the deposit on a property.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Property Ownership, Planning, and Sales Processes
A. Manner of Holding
Property ownership in Singapore can be held in two ways:
Holding Type
Ownership
Succession
Recommended Use
Tenancy-in-Common
Each owner holds a specified, unequal share (e.g., 99%/1%).
Follows testate/intestate succession rules.
Friends/family members with intended unequal shares.
Joint Tenancy
Undivided joint interest.
Passes to the surviving owner.
Common for spouses.
B. Fractional Purchases (Decoupling)
A fractional purchase involves an existing owner (A) selling their share of the property to another existing owner (B) (e.g., Joint Tenancy or Tenancy in Common 50/50 or 99/1). Alternatively, an existing owner sells a percentage share to another person, forming a Co-Ownership based on Tenancy in Common (e.g., 99/1).
Key financial aspects for the buyer (B):
• Buyer (B) forms up the purchase price using Cash / CPF / Loan.
• Buyer (B) restructures their existing share of the loan.
• Buyer (B) pays for Buyer Stamp Duty (BSD) on the share of property purchased.
• In forming co-ownership (e.g., 99/1), the new co-owner (B) owning 1% can use CPF Ordinary Account funds for instalments and their income can be recognised for Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) calculation.
• For the seller (A), if the sale is a negative sale, a Full CPF Refund is required.
C. Divorce and Property Division
In the event of a divorce, the Court may order the division of matrimonial property in various ways:
• A Sale in the Open Market.
• A Sale from one party to the other (proceeds as a Fractional Purchase).
• A Transfer without Cash & CPF Consideration (proceeds as Refinancing).
• A Transfer with CPF consideration only (proceeds as Refinancing, including CPF refund, with LTV Capped at 75%).
• A Transfer with both Cash & CPF Consideration (proceeds as Refinancing, including CPF refund with LTV Capped at 75%, but no financing is allowed for cash considerations).
D. Planning and Conservation
• Concept Plan: Guides Singapore’s development over 50 years, reviewed every 10 years, mapping long-term transportation and strategic land usage.
• Master Plan: Guides physical development, first published in 1958, reviewed every 5 years. It is a statutory plan showing land use (e.g., Residential, Commercial), translating the Concept Plan vision into detailed implementation plans.
• Plot Ratio and Building Height: Residential developments follow Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) / Storey Height Control Limit. Examples include GPR of 1.4 corresponding to 5 storeys, and GPR of >2.8 corresponding to >36 stories.
• Conservation: Retention of old buildings with more lenient rules than preservation. Conservation status means the building cannot be demolished, and original structural/architectural properties must be retained. Envelop control allows a building to be demolished and rebuilt, provided it adheres to specific conditions like design, height, and roof form.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Contracts, Transactions, and Timelines
A. Option to Purchase (OTP)
The OTP grants exclusive rights to the buyer for an agreed defined period in exchange for an option fee. Once granted, it is the Buyer’s right to buy but they are not a must to buy and forfeit the option fee if they do not exercise. The seller, once granting the OTP, has a must to sell obligation.

VI. Regulatory Calculations and Financial Limits (MAS & IRAS)
A. Income Recognition (MAS Notice 645)
For TDSR and MSR calculations, income is recognised as follows: | Income Type | Recognition Rate | Regulatory Basis | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Monthly Basic Salary | $\mathbf{100%}$ | MAS 645 § 10(a) | | Variable Income (e.g., bonus) | $\mathbf{70%}$ of annual variable income, divided by 12 | MAS 645 § 10(b) | | Rental Income | $\mathbf{70%}$ (if $\geq 6$ months lease remaining) | MAS 645 § 10(c) | | Self-employed Income | $\mathbf{70%}$ of latest NOA (if $\geq 2$ years in business) | MAS 645 § 10(b) |
B. Tenure Limits and IWAA Calculation
Maximum tenure is capped based on the Income-Weighted Average Age (IWAA) of the borrowers.
IWAA Calculation: $\text{IWAA} = \sum(\text{Age} \times \text{Income}) / \sum(\text{Income})$.
Property Type
Max Tenure Allowed
Calculation
HDB Loan
$\mathbf{30}$ years
Lower of $\mathbf{75 - \text{IWAA}}$ or $\mathbf{30}$ years.
Private/EC Loan
$\mathbf{35}$ years
Lower of $\mathbf{75 - \text{IWAA}}$ or $\mathbf{35}$ years.
C. Debt Servicing Ratios
Loan affordability is measured using a stress test rate of $\text{MAX}(\text{package rate}, \mathbf{4.00%})$ for residential property.
1. Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR): Applies to HDB and EC developer units.
    ◦ Formula: $\text{MSR} = \text{Potential Mortgage Liability} / \text{Total Income} \leq \mathbf{30%}$.
2. Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR): Applies to all purchases, refinancing, and credit secured by property.
    ◦ Formula: $\text{TDSR} = (\text{Total Monthly Debt Obligations} + \text{Potential Mortgage Liability}) / \text{Total Monthly Income} \leq \mathbf{55%}$.
Total Monthly Debt Obligations include:
• Credit cards: $\text{MAX}(\mathbf{3%} \times \text{Outstanding Balance}, \mathbf{$50})$.
• Guarantor Exposure: $\mathbf{20%}$ of the guaranteed loan’s monthly instalment.
D. Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Downpayments
LTV is calculated based on the purchase price or valuation, whichever is lower.
Scenario
LTV Limit
Minimum Cash Downpayment
Standard Purchase
$\mathbf{75%}$
$\mathbf{5%}$ cash
Extended Purchase
$\mathbf{55%}$
$\mathbf{10%}$ cash
E. Buyer's Stamp Duty (BSD) and ABSD (IRAS 2025 Rates)
Stamp duties are calculated on the purchase price or valuation, whichever is higher.
Buyer’s Stamp Duty (BSD) Tiers: | Bracket | Rate | Incremental Tax | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | 1st $180,000 | 1% | $1,800 | | Next $180,000 | 2% | $3,600 | | Next $640,000 | 3% | $19,200 | | Next $500,000 | 4% | $20,000 | | Next $1.5 million | 5% | $75,000 | | Above $3 million | 6% | Balance $\times 6%$ |
Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) Rates: | Profile | 1st Property | 2nd Property | 3rd+ Property | Entities | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Singapore Citizen | 0% | 20% | 30% | N/A | | Permanent Resident | 5% | 30% | 35% | N/A | | Foreigners | 60% | N/A | N/A | N/A | | Entities | N/A | N/A | N/A | 65% |
F. Equity Loans (Cash-Out)
For private properties post-TOP, borrowers may take out an Equity Loan (5th-Charge Loan).
• Maximum Equity Available: Current Market Valuation $\times \mathbf{75%} - \text{Outstanding Loan} - \text{CPF Used (with accrued interest)}$.
• Repayments must be cash-only.
G. Bridging Loans
Bridging loans cover the cash gap while waiting for sale proceeds.
• Maximum repayment period is typically $\sim 6$ months.
