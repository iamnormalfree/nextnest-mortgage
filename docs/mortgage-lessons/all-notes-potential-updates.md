Based on the comprehensive knowledge base compiled from the sources, the following areas contain dates, rates, limits, or review periods that are inherently dynamic or explicitly stated as being subject to future change or periodic updates, and therefore might require refreshing.
I. Regulatory Caps and Stress Test Parameters
These rules, set primarily by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and HDB, are key macro-prudential tools and are frequently adjusted based on economic conditions:
1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Limits for HDB Loans: The sources specify the LTV cap for HDB loans as Up to 75% (w.e.f. 20 Aug 2024). Since an effective date is provided, this remains a point of potential future revision by the authorities.
2. Residential Property Stress Test Rate: Loan affordability for MSR and TDSR is calculated using a stress test rate, explicitly noted as $\text{MAX}(\text{package rate}, \mathbf{4.00%})$ for residential property. This 4.00% minimum is a policy rate set by the MAS and could be subject to change.
3. Income Recognition for Debts (Credit Cards): The calculation for credit card monthly obligation, set at $\text{MAX}(\mathbf{3%} \times \text{Outstanding Balance}, \mathbf{$50})$, is a fixed regulatory rule (MAS 645) but the minimum dollar amount ($$50$) or the percentage (3%) could be updated.
4. IWAA and Maximum Tenure Rules: Although the formulae linking tenure to the Income-Weighted Average Age (IWAA) (e.g., $75 - \text{IWAA}$) are fixed policy, the actual product-specific maximum cap (30 years for HDB and 35 years for Private/EC) remains a potential area for future adjustment.
II. Taxes and Duties (IRAS)
Tax rates are generally reviewed during the annual budget cycle:
1. Buyer’s Stamp Duty (BSD) Rates: The tiered structure for BSD, which goes up to 6% for amounts above $$3$ million, is quoted specifically based on the IRAS 2025 Rates. These rates and brackets are subject to review.
2. Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) Rates: The ABSD percentages (e.g., 60% for foreigners, 30% for SC 3rd property) are tools for moderating residential demand and are frequently revised by the government.
3. Seller's Stamp Duty (SSD): The sources note that SSD is payable if a property is sold within a specified holding period, with rates decreasing by year. Both the holding period and the applicable rates are periodically reviewed.
4. Tenancy Agreement Stamp Duty (Lease Duty): The stamp duty rate for Tenancy Agreements, noted as 0.4% of contract value for leases $\leq 4$ years, is a defined tax percentage that may change.
III. CPF Rules and Monetary Sums
CPF figures are typically updated annually to reflect inflation and changing retirement needs:
1. Basic and Full Retirement Sums (BRS/FRS): The table detailing the BRS/FRS is explicitly updated annually, with figures provided up to 1 January 2027. This ensures that the retirement sums for 2026 and 2027 will need verification upon those dates.
2. HDB Concessionary Loan Interest Rate: This rate is indexed to the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate plus 0.10%. Changes in the underlying CPF OA interest rate will cause the HDB loan rate to change.
3. Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) Amounts: The source provides tables with "Current" and "Revised" EHG amounts, indicating these grants are subject to policy adjustments.
4. HDB Eligibility Conditions (15-Month Rule): The requirement that HDB resale buyers must not have disposed of a private property in the last 15 months is explicitly noted as being "(Subjected to Review / Removal)".
IV. Planning and Development Cycles
Planning timelines ensure that long-term strategies are regularly revisited and implemented:
1. Master Plan Review: The Master Plan, which details land use and development, is reviewed every 5 years.
2. Concept Plan Review: The Concept Plan, which guides Singapore's development over 50 years, is reviewed every 10 years.
V. Financial Market Benchmarks and Bank Policies
Rates tied to the financial market or internal bank policies are inherently unstable:
1. Floating Interest Rate Benchmarks (SORA/SIBOR/FD-Pegged): Rates based on SORA (Singapore Overnight Rate Average) or FD-pegged benchmarks are volatile, reflecting daily or monthly market movements.
2. Bank Penalties and Claw-back Periods: Common penalties such as Full Redemption Penalty ($\mathbf{1.50%} \mathbf{– 1.75%}$), Partial Redemption Penalty ($\sim \mathbf{1.50%}$), and Cancellation Fees ($\mathbf{0.75%} \mathbf{– 1.50%}$) are set by Financial Institutions (FIs) and may change based on their specific Letter of Offer packages and internal risk appetite.
3. Subsidy Claw-back Duration: The period for reimbursement/claw-back of legal/valuation subsidies or cash rebates is noted as typically $\sim 3$ years (occasionally 2 years). This specific duration is determined by the lending FI and should be verified for current packages.
