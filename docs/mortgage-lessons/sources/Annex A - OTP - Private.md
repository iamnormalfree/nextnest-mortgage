OPTION TO PURCHASE
FOR TRANSACTION OF PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL
PROPERTY

1.
The  Digitalised  Property  Transactions  Workgroup  (DPTWG)  aims  to  move  the  real  estate
industry  towards  offering  seamless,  efficient,  and  secure  digital  property  transactions.  As  a  step
towards meeting the objective, the DPTWG is working on promoting the use of contract templates
for property transactions, which subsequently could then be digitalised and executed electronically
in  future.  The  DPTWG  has  earlier  completed  contract  templates  for  the  lease  of  residential
properties  and  has  now  developed  the  following  Option  to  Purchase  template  for  the  sale  and
purchase of a private residential property.

2.

The following Option to Purchase template is divided into two main sections:

(a)  The Option to Purchase – which contains the main generally-applicable clauses that will

govern parties’ obligations for the sale and purchase of the property.

(b)  Annexes  A  to  D  –  Annexes  A to  C  contain  additional  modes to  vary  the scope of the
relevant corresponding clauses in the Option to Purchase, and Annex D enables parties
to  add  or  vary  terms  of  the  Option  to  Purchase.  Each  of  the  Annexes  comes  with  an
Explanatory Note which should be read carefully together with the Option to Purchase.

3.
Please note that use of this Option to Purchase is not mandated and parties are free to amend
the  template  or  negotiate  on  the  terms  contained  in  the  document  to  suit  their  needs  and/or
requirements.

IMPORTANT: This document is intended as a guide to generally applicable terms and conditions
in  an  Option  to  Purchase. You  expressly  understand and  agree  that  you  assume  full responsibility
and risk for your use of this document, whether on an “as is” basis or as may be amended by you.
The  DPTWG  including  each  of  its  members,  does  not  make  any  express  or  implied  warranties  or
representations as to the suitability of this document for all transactions and shall not be liable in any
way  to  you  whether  in  contract,  tort  or  otherwise  for  any  direct  and  indirect  loss  or  damage
(including but not limited to economic and financial loss or damage) howsoever arising or caused,
arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  the  use  of  this  document.  When  in  doubt,  you  are  strongly
encouraged to seek professional advice in relation to transacting for the sale and purchase of a
private  residential  property  on  such  terms  and  conditions  that  are  best  suited  to  your  needs
and requirements.
