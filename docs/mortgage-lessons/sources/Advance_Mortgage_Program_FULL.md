## Development of Singapore 【6†Advance Mortgage Program.pdf】

### Master Plan 【6†Advance Mortgage Program.pdf】
The plan that is instrumental in guiding Singapore’s physical development
- First published in 1958, reviewed every 5 years.
- Statutory plan that shows land use and development. (e.g. Residential, Commercial, Healthcare, Education Institution etc)
- The plan introduces the idea of charting urban growth and development.
- Translate the vision of Concept Plan into detailed implementation plans.
- Intensity changes with allocated plot ratio of land.

### Plot ratio and building height plan 【6†Advance Mortgage Program.pdf】
Residential developments generally have a Gross Plot Ratio / Storey height Control Limit.  
Other land uses that do not have a specific height control will be subjected to evaluation in determining the height allowed.

| Gross Plot Ratio | Storey Height Control |
|---:|---:|
| 1.4 | 5 |
| 1.6 | 12 |
| 2.1 | 24 |
| 2.8 | 36 |
| > 2.8 | > 36 |

### Concept Plan 【6†Advance Mortgage Program.pdf】
The guide for Singapore’s development over 50 years
- First developed in 1971, reviewed every 10 years.
- Maps out long-term plans for transportation and strategic land usage.
- Ensure sufficient land to meet long term needs.

### Conservation 【6†Advance Mortgage Program.pdf】
The authority of conservation in Singapore is the URA. It identifies, researches and recommends areas for conversation such as historic building. It also proposes building restoration, addition, alteration and redevelopment.

**Preservation:** Ensure a building is kept in its original architecture. 
- Buildings that are preserved are usually institutional and religious building

**Conservation:** Retention of old buildings with more lenient rules compared to preservation. 
- Certain alterations, rebuilding, new materials and up to date design and construction techniques are allowed.

Buildings in a particular conservation area can either be classified as for **conservation** or for **envelop control**:
- **Conservation:** building cannot be demolished, its original structural and architectural properties have to be retained. If any of its properties are to be repaired/replace, their features have to be kept.
- **Envelop control:** where a building can be demolished and rebuilt but the building has to adhere to certain conditions such as, design, building height roof form and covered walkway etc.

---

## Collective Sales (En-bloc) 【6†Advance Mortgage Program.pdf】
The sale of entire private strata development
- Done by way of majority consent to the buyer.
- Proceeds of sale are divided between the owners of the said development.

**When can a collective sale happen?**
- Increased Plot Ratio: Due to changes to Master Plan, there is prospect for better development.
- Physical Obsolesces: for older developments, they may be functionally obsolete in their layout and building services, and repair works will be too costly so it would make more sense to redevelop through a collective sale.

**Consent thresholds**
- If the development is **less than 10 years old**, at least **90%** consent by share value and Strata Area is required
- If the development is **more than 10 years old**, at least **80%** consent by share value and Strata Area is required

**Reasons for En-bloc to fail**
- Majority consent not met.
- Reserve price not met.
- Unit owner(s) suffer from monetary loss due to en-bloc.
- Sales proceed of a unit is not able to redeem any mortgage / CPF charge on the property.
- Non-compliance of regulatory requirements.
