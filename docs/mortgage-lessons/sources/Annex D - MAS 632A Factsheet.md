Policy is required.
E.  Footnotes
1  The loan amount of $800,000 is 80% of the lower of the purchase price after deducting any discount or benefit

($1,050,000) and the (indicative) current market valuation ($1,000,000).

2  The cash down payment of $50,000 is 5% of the lower of the purchase price after deducting any discount or
benefit ($1,050,000) and the (indicative) current market valuation ($1,000,000). This is the regulatory minimum
requirement. Your FI should explain to you if you are required to pay additional cash on top of the regulatory
minimum requirement.

3  Lock-in Period (if any) refers to the period where penalties may apply if you repay part of or your entire property

loan, or if you re-finance with the same FI or a different FI.

4  We have assumed that the loan is given to you in full in Year 0, with repayments beginning in Year 1. For loans
on uncompleted properties, Year 1 also refers to the first year after the loan has been given to you in full.
5  SIBOR refers to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate. Your FI should tell you where you can find the reference
rate, how often this rate  may be adjusted, and under what circumstances this rate may be changed for the
purpose of the loan. The values of reference rates based on market rates such as Singapore Interbank Offered
Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR) will vary according to market movements. If reference







rates are based on your FI’s internal rate, the value of the reference rate may vary as it is set internally by your
FI.

If the Lock-in Period of the loan is Y years, the FI must give you illustrations for a minimum of Y+1 years.

6
7  This figure is based on the assumption that: (1) there are no changes to the tenure of the loan; and (2) there are

no further changes in the interest rate.

8  The actual changes in the reference rate may be higher or lower than the examples we have given.
F.  Important notes
1  If  you  sell  your  property  after  buying  it,  you  may  have  to  pay  a  Seller’s  Stamp  Duty.  You  can  find  more

information at IRAS’ website at www.iras.gov.sg.

2  The  interest  rates  used  in  this  fact  sheet  are  mostly  based  on  estimates.  Actual  interest  rates  may  be

different, and may be higher than what is shown here.

3  Your FI may have the right to ask for additional payments if your property falls in value.
4  This fact sheet aims to provide essential information on your property loan. You should still read the loan’s
terms and conditions. Before you commit to a loan, please read the consumer guide ‘About Home Loans –
Key Questions to Ask the Bank Before Taking a Home Loan’ produced by MoneySENSE and the Association
of  Banks  in  Singapore.  You  can  ask  your  FI  for  a  copy  of  the  guide  or  you  can  download  a  copy  at
MoneySENSE’s website at www.moneysense.gov.sg.

5  If you are using CPF savings to buy the property, you should be aware of the rules on CPF usage. In particular,
you may not be able to use CPF savings to make your monthly loan repayments for the full period of the
loan. This is because the use of CPF savings towards your property (including the housing loan) is governed
by the relevant CPF Withdrawal Limit and CPF Valuation Limit. You should also know that you need to set
aside the relevant Retirement Sum at age 55, which could reduce the CPF savings that you can use towards
buying  your  property  or  paying  off  your  housing  loan  at  that  point.  Visit  the  CPF  Board's  website  at
www.cpf.gov.sg for more information.

6   If you miss a monthly repayment, your FI can:

(i)  declare ‘an event of default’ and make you repay the full loan;
(ii)  charge you a higher rate of interest;
(iii)  begin legal action to make you pay the amount you owe or sell your property (or both) to recover

what you owe plus unpaid interest; or
(iv)  bring bankruptcy proceedings against you.

To avoid these situations, you should:

•  not commit yourself to a loan that you cannot afford;
•

contact your FI immediately for help if you face an unexpected financial situation (for example,
sudden job loss) and have difficulty with making your repayments; and
•  not wait until you miss a repayment before taking appropriate action.

7  Some  FIs  may  require  you  to  take  up  a  Mortgagee  Interest  Policy  (MIP)  if  your  private  apartment  or

condominium is mortgaged to them.

The MIP protects the FI’s interest. It allows the FI to claim for repayment of the outstanding property loan
amount from the insurer, in the event of damage to the property due to an insured event (such as fire) and
the FI has concerns over your loan repayment. You remain liable for the outstanding property loan amount.


Please note that the FI does not restrict your choice of MIP provider, and any additional insurance coverage
offered  together  with  the  MIP  is  optional.  However,  the  FI  may  impose  an  administrative  charge  if  you
choose to obtain an MIP from an insurer not arranged by the FI.

There may be other FIs that do not require an MIP. Please refer to the Association of Banks in Singapore’s
website at www.abs.org.sg for more information on MIP.

8  Should you re-finance your  property loan, certain financing  rules (e.g. loan  tenure limit) may apply.  You

should approach your FI for further information.
