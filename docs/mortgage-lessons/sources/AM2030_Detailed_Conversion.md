- **Reference + Spread** structure similar to SORA. *(Note: phased out in practice, but included for historical understanding.)*

### Board Rates
- Bank‑managed internal rates (less transparent; bank has discretion; 1‑month notice for changes).  
- Can be priced as **Board + spread** *or* **Board – discount** (e.g., Board 6% – 4.50% → 1.50%).

### Fixed Deposit (FD)‑Pegged

- *Cash/FD Pledged:* **$200,000 / 48 = $4,166.67/mth**.
