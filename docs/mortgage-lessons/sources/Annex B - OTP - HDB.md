# Annex B - OTP - HDB

IMPORTANT NOTES ON OPTION TO PURCHASE

Sellers  and  buyers  of  resale  HDB  flats  are  advised  to  read  these  notes  and  the  clauses  of  the  Option  to
Purchase before completing the form and entering into a contract for the sale and purchase of the flat.

1.

Intent to Sell/Buy

All resale applications are processed via the HDB Resale Portal, which is accessible on the HDB InfoWEB
(www.hdb.gov.sg).  The  HDB  Resale  Portal  integrates  all  the  eligibility  checks,  provide  the  essential
information to the sellers and buyers, and guide them through the process for the sale or purchase of the flat.

Sellers must register an Intent to Sell in the HDB Resale Portal at least 7 days before granting an Option to
Purchase to the buyers.

Buyers must register an Intent to Buy before being granted an Option to Purchase by the sellers.

The  resale  application  for  the  sale  and  purchase  of  the  flat  will  not  be  accepted  by  HDB  if  the  sellers  and
buyers  do  not  register  their  Intent  to Sell/Buy or the timelines for registering their  Intent to  Sell/Buy are not
adhered to.

2.

HDB prescribed Option to Purchase

Sellers  and  buyers  of  resale  flats  must  use  the  HDB  prescribed  Option  to  Purchase  (OTP)  as  the  form  of
contract in resale transactions.  No party is allowed to enter into any other agreement pertaining to the sale
and purchase of the flat as it is null and void pursuant to the Housing and Development Act.

3.

Option to Purchase Form

The current prescribed OTP form (effective 1 January 2018) shall be downloaded from the HDB InfoWEB. No
amendments  may  be  made  to  the  prescribed  form. Amendments  include  (but  are  not  limited  to) deletions,
insertions or altering any provision in the prescribed OTP form.

4.

Option Fee, Deposit and Option Period

These are the prescribed Option Fee, Deposit and Option Period:

Option Fee

Deposit

- An amount not exceeding $1,000

- An amount not exceeding $5,000

(Option Fee + Option Exercise Fee = Deposit)

Option Period

- 21 calendar days (including Sat/Sun & public holidays) after the Option Date.

[E.g.  If  the  seller  grants  an  Option  to  the  buyer  on  1  January  2021  (Friday), the
Option  will  expire  on  22  January  2021  (Friday).  The  Option  expiry  time  is
standardised at 4pm.]

Sellers and buyers must state an amount for the Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee. Neither fee can be $0.
This is to ensure that there is a valid Option or contract. The Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee will form
the Deposit for the purchase of the flat.

5.

Sellers must meet Minimum Occupation Period before granting the OTP (Clause 3 of OTP)

Sellers  must  meet  the  minimum  occupation  period  for  the  flat  before  granting  the  OTP, otherwise  the  OTP
entered into will be null and void. Besides the HDB Resale Portal, sellers can check their eligibility to sell at
www.hdb.gov.sg>e-Services>Selling your flat>Request for Confirmation of Eligibility to Sell Your HDB Flat.

1















6.

Housing Loan

Buyers who are eligible for and intend to obtain an HDB housing loan must have a valid HDB Loan Eligibility
Letter  when  the  sellers  grant  them  the  OTP.  The  HDB  Loan  Eligibility  Letter  is  valid  for  6  months  from  the
date of issue.

Buyers  who  are  taking  a  bank  loan  must  have  a  valid  Letter  of  Offer  from  a  bank/financial  institution  when
they exercise the OTP.

Buyers who are not taking any housing loan are not required to obtain an HDB Loan Eligibility letter from HDB
or  a  Letter  of  Offer  from  a  bank/financial  institution, but will have to indicate that they are financing the flat
purchase fully with their CPF savings and/or cash when they submit the resale application to HDB.

7.

Declared Resale Price

Sellers  and  buyers  must  declare  to  HDB  the  true  resale  price  of  the  flat. They  must  not  enter  into  any
supplementary  or  other  agreements  or  arrangements  that  may  cause  the  resale  price  as declared  to  be
inflated or understated.

8.

Value of Flat (Clause 4 of OTP)

Buyers who are using their  CPF moneys and/or taking up a housing loan to finance their flat purchase, will
need  to  submit  a request  to  HDB  ("Request  for  Value")  to  determine  the  value  of  the  flat  which  forms  the
basis for their housing loan and CPF usage.

The Request for Value may only be submitted by the buyers who have been granted an OTP by the sellers.

The buyers (or their salesperson) must submit to HDB the Request for Value, together with a scanned copy
of page 1 of the OTP, by the next working day after the Option Date.

If a valuation of the flat is required by HDB, the flat owners (sellers) must allow the assigned valuer to inspect
the flat within 3 working days of being informed by HDB of the assigned valuer.

HDB will inform the buyers via email once the value of the flat is available in the HDB Resale Portal, which
will typically be within 10 working days.

9.

Procedure in granting and exercising the Option to Purchase

The procedure for entering into a binding contract for a resale transaction is as follows:

a.

Sellers grant the OTP

The  sellers  grant  an  OTP  to  the  buyers  to  purchase  the  flat  at  the  agreed  resale  price  and  for  an
Option Period of 21 days during which the sellers cannot sell the flat or make an offer to other buyers.
The OTP must be signed by all the sellers (on page 8 of the OTP) before it is granted to the buyers. If
the buyers are getting an HDB housing loan, the sellers must check that the buyers have a valid HDB
Loan Eligibility Letter before granting them the OTP.

b.

Buyers pay the Option Fee
In exchange, the buyers pay an Option Fee (preferably in a cheque) to the sellers. The buyers have up
to 21 days to exercise the OTP. During that period, the buyers can apply for a bank's Letter of Offer (if
they are getting a bank loan) or make other arrangements/enquiries relating to the purchase.

c.

Buyers exercise the OTP

If the buyers decide to purchase the flat, the buyers must exercise the OTP within the Option Period.
To exercise the OTP, the buyers must do the following:

(i) sign the Acceptance portion in page 8 of the OTP (if the buyers are getting a bank loan, the buyers
must ensure that the date of issue of the bank's Letter of Offer is before the date of Acceptance),

(ii) deliver the signed OTP to the Sellers*, and

(iii) pay a sum called the Option Exercise Fee to the Sellers.

The Acceptance must be signed by all the buyers. For record purposes, the buyers are advised to obtain a
signed acknowledgement from the sellers on the buyer's copy of the Acceptance, stating the date and time of
exercise of the Option.

2





























Upon exercise of the OTP, the sellers and the buyers enter into a binding contract for the sale and purchase
of the flat.

*The sellers can appoint another person or a firm (e.g. solicitor's firm or estate agent) to receive the signed
OTP  and the Option Exercise Fee by completing the Authorisation Form (Form A) provided in the OTP. The
appointed person or firm should be easily contactable.  If the authorised party is a salesperson of an estate
agent or a solicitor/solicitor's firm, it is advisable that the payment of the Option Exercise Fee be made in a
cheque payable to the sellers, as salespersons and solicitors are not allowed to receive cash for their clients
or hold their client's money.

The buyers are advised not to wait till the last hour to exercise the OTP as the OTP will expire if the buyers
for any reason fail to exercise the OTP within the Option Period. If the buyers decide not to proceed with the
purchase, they can let the OTP expire and lose only the Option Fee.

10. Witness for Signature

A  witness  to  the  signing  of  the  OTP  can  serve  as  proof  that  a  contract  has  been  entered  into. Sellers  and
buyers can get their salesperson (if they have engaged one) or anyone above the age of 21 to witness their
signatures. The witness need not be present for the HDB appointment.

11. English version to be signed by parties

Sellers and buyers must ensure that they sign only on the English version of the OTP. HDB will only accept
the English version of the OTP.

12.

Inventory List (Clause 10.2 of OTP)

An  inventory  list  (optional)  on  movable  property,  fittings  and  other  items  (e.g.  furniture  or  other  movable
items)  may  be completed  and  signed  by  the  sellers  and  buyers.  The  prescribed  form  is  available  in  the
Schedule attached to the OTP.

13.

Liability of Payment for Upgrading Cost (Clause 11 of OTP)

For flats under HDB's Upgrading Programmes, whoever is the flat owner as at the date of billing has to pay
the upgrading cost.

● If  the  date  of  billing  is  before  completion  of  the  resale  transaction,  the  seller  has  to  pay  the  upgrading

cost.

● If the date of billing is after completion of the resale transaction, the buyer has to pay the upgrading cost.

Sellers and buyers may check the schedule of billing dates for the completed precincts at the respective HDB
Branch or at www.hdb.gov.sg under Home>Living in HDB Flats>Upgrading Programmes.

14. Submission of Resale Application and Completion Date (Clauses 12 and 13 of OTP)

Sellers and buyers are to mutually agree on when to submit their portion of the resale application to HDB and
ensure that the complete resale application is submitted within the timeframe they have agreed.

The  completion  date  will  be  within  8  weeks  from  the  date  of  HDB's  acceptance  of  the  resale  application,
unless  extended  by  HDB. As this is the earliest possible date  to  complete  the  transaction,  HDB  will  not  be
able to accede to any request to advance the completion date. Any request to extend the completion date can
be considered, subject to the request being made jointly by the sellers and buyers.

15. Sellers' and Buyers' Obligations (Clauses 14 and 15 of OTP)

Sellers  and  buyers  are  to  keep  to  the  timelines  to  endorse  the  resale  documents,  make  the  necessary
payments, and fulfil the conditions of the resale approval, as requested by HDB. Any delay in complying with
the timelines for the endorsement or payment, or in fulfilling the approval conditions may result in the resale
completion being postponed or the cancellation of the resale application.

The  postponement  of  the  resale  completion  or  cancellation  of  the  resale  application  shall  not in  any  way
prejudice the rights of the sellers or buyers to take such action (if any) as they may deem fit pursuant to the
contract for sale and purchase as evidenced by the Option to Purchase, including but not limited to any late
completion  interest. HDB  shall  not  be  responsible  or  liable  to any  party  for  any  action,  proceeding,  claim,
demand, liability, loss, charge, damage, cost and/or expense which may be brought against, become payable
by and/or incurred by any party arising from or in relation to the postponement or cancellation (as the case
may be).

3

















16. No Supplemental Agreement

Sellers and buyers must not enter into any other agreement or supplemental agreement relating to the sale
and purchase of the flat. They must also not make any arrangement or promises or enter into any agreement
for the:

a.

b.

payment of any further sums of money while waiting for the completion of the resale of the flat; or

purchase or disposal of the flat with any other person.

17. Advice for Sellers and Buyers

Sellers must:
a.

Ensure that they are eligible to sell their flat in the open market, e.g. they must have met the minimum
occupation  period  and  their  buyers  can  comply  with  the  Ethnic  Integration  Policy  and  Singapore
Permanent Resident Quota Policy when submitting the resale application.

b.

Calculate the estimated proceeds they will get from the sale. Take note that:

(i)

If the resale price is not enough to settle the outstanding loan in full, the sellers will have to pay the
shortfall in the loan amount in cash before the resale transaction can proceed.

(ii) If the resale price can cover the outstanding loan in full but is not enough for the full refund of the
sellers'  CPF  moneys, the  cash  deposit  received  by  the  sellers  will  have  to  be  used  for  refund  to
their CPF account(s).

Settle  any  outstanding  upgrading  cost  in  full  before  the  resale  transaction  can  complete. For  flats
undergoing  resale,  CPF  members  are  not  allowed  to  withdraw  their  CPF  savings  to  pay  for  the
outstanding upgrading cost. The amount will be deducted from the cash proceeds, if any.

Plan for their next housing before selling their flat. Please note that ex-HDB flat owners are not eligible
to  apply  for  a  rental  flat  from  HDB  immediately  after  selling  their  flat. HDB  rental  flats  are  meant  for
low-income citizen households who cannot afford to buy flats and have no other housing options.

c.

d.

Buyers must:
a.

Ensure that they can buy a resale flat under one of the eligibility schemes and that they comply with
the Ethnic Integration Policy and Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) Quota Policy when submitting
the resale application. SPR households may only buy a flat after they have obtained their SPR status
for at least 3 years.

b.

c.

d.

Ensure that they have sufficient funds (CPF/cash/housing loan) to buy a flat. Take note that there are
restrictions on the use of CPF moneys and obtaining an HDB loan if buyers are buying a flat where the
age  of  the  youngest  buyer  and  the  remaining  lease  of  the  flat  is  less  than  95  years. Banks/financial
institutions  also  take  this  into  account  when  granting  home  loans. Buyers  must  do  their  financial
planning and buy a flat which they can afford.

Consider  carefully  before  they  and  their  parent/child  buy  a  flat  together. If  subsequently,  one  owner
wishes  to  relinquish  his/her  interest  in  the  flat, the remaining owner(s) will need to meet an eligibility
scheme and has the financial means to complete the following in order to retain the flat:

(i) discharge the outstanding mortgage loan (if any);

(ii) pay cash consideration (if any) to the outgoing owner;

(iii) refund the CPF monies used (including accrued interest) to the outgoing owner; and

(iv) pay the fees involved in the transaction.

Check  if  they  are  eligible  for  an  HDB  housing  loan,  or  if  they  would  need  a  housing  loan  from  a
bank/financial institution to finance their flat purchase. If buyers are getting a housing loan, they should
find out the loan amount they can get by obtaining an HDB Loan Eligibility Letter or a bank's Letter of
Offer before they commit to the purchase (see Note 9), as credit assessment will be carried out.

e.

Take note that Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats are HDB flats which were designed, built
and sold by private developers under Part IVB of the Housing and Development Act. Any reference to
an HDB flat shall include a DBSS flat. Each DBSS development is characterised by its own distinctive
external  features.  To  maintain  the  aesthetic  appearance  of  each  development  and  to  be  in  line  with
URA's Gross Floor Area (GFA) Incentive Scheme, specific renovation restrictions apply to DBSS flats.
This may include renovation restrictions that apply to the balcony, air-conditioner ledge, planter boxes
and service yard.

Buyers  must  check  the  HDB  InfoWEB  (www.hdb.gov.sg)  for  all  the  renovation  guidelines  and
restrictions  that  apply  to  DBSS  flats, including  but  not  limited  to  the  type  of  renovations  they  can  or
cannot do at/to the balcony, air-conditioner ledge, planter boxes, bay window and service yard, before
they  exercise  the  OTP.  Once  the  OTP  is  exercised,  the  buyers  are  deemed  to  have  read  and
understood all  the  applicable  renovation  guidelines  and  restrictions  and  shall  be  bound  by  all  the
renovation  restrictions  applicable  to  the  DBSS  flat. HDB  reserves  the  right  to  amend  the  applicable
renovation  restrictions  in  line  with  the  prevailing  policies  of  HDB  and  the  relevant  authorities  without
prior notice.

Giving False Information

It  is  an  offence  under  Section  60  of  Housing  &  Development  Act  for  any  person  to  give  false
information  relating  to  the  buying  or  selling  of  an  HDB  flat. Any  person  who  gives  false  information
shall  be  guilty  of  an  offence  and  shall  be  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $5,000  or  to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

HDB  also  reserves  the  right  to  debar  any  person  who  makes  a  false  statement  from  buying  a  flat^,
taking over ownership of a flat^ by way of transfer, being included as an essential occupier of a flat^ or
taking  up  an  HDB  housing  loan  for  a  period  of  5  years  from  the  date  of  cancellation  of  the  resale
application  or the date of approval to compulsorily acquire the flat. Any existing application registered
in the HDB's rental waiting list will also be cancelled.

Housing Scheme)
