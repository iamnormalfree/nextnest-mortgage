# MAS & SG Mortgage Essentials (KB)
- **TDSR** caps total monthly debt obligations as a share of gross monthly income.
- **MSR** applies to HDB/EC only (not private).
- **Valuation & legal** fees apply on refinancing; sometimes subsidised (clawback during lock-in).
- **Repricing vs Refinancing**: Repricing = stay with current bank (no broker commission). Refinancing = switch bank (broker commission eligible).
- **Lock-in** typical 1â€“3y; breaking incurs penalty (often ~1.5% of outstanding) if within lock-in.
