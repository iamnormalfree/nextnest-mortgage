Writing System (Embodied Logic Mode)
1) Observe

The job isn’t “write.” The job is “produce a clear, defensible idea that changes what someone will do next.” If a paragraph doesn’t change an action, it’s ballast.

Constraints matter. Tools and workflow exist to reduce friction so ideas can be iterated quickly and ruthlessly edited. Jason historically drafts in a plain-text toolchain, not inside WordPress; he writes in a text editor with lightweight markup, then pastes/schedules—because simple tools make it easier to cut and refactor without fighting a CMS.

One meta-constraint: favor specifics over generalities. Specifics increase trust and memorability; they also self-police vagueness during drafting.

Presentation is part of the craft. Longform exists because format (typography, images, print/PDF) influences comprehension and shareability; therefore, the publishing surface is engineered on purpose.

2) Simplify (minimal accurate description)

Writing = (One sharp claim) × (Concrete proof) ÷ (Unnecessary words)

Corollaries:

One article = one point. Everything else serves that point or gets cut.

“Be specific” is the fastest path to both clarity and persuasion.

Editing is the primary act; drafting only gives raw material. (Editing feels 10x easier and yields the quality.)

3) Rebuild (method, step-by-step)
A. Idea capture → single-claim filter

Collect sparks: notes from conversations, customer emails, contrarian moments, and personal mistakes.

Distill to one sentence: “This post proves ____.” If you can’t complete that blank without conjunctions, you have multiple posts jammed together.

Stress the claim with a built-in skeptic (a “devil’s advocate” habit): Why would a smart person disagree? What example falsifies this? Keep what survives.

B. Outline → structure by evidence

Start with observables (what actually happened), not labels.

Arrange proof in increasing force: example → counterexample → mechanism → implication.

Make it concrete: numbers, named cases, and decisions you actually took (e.g., survivor bias, PMF misreads, hiring tradeoffs). Specificity prevents hand-waving.

C. Draft in low-friction environment

Use plain text + lightweight markup to prevent format fiddling; paste to CMS only when the logic already clicks. Schedule later. 
@ASmartBear

D. Edit like an owner (ruthless compression)

Run passes that each do one job:

Point-pass: Delete any paragraph that doesn’t advance the one claim.

Specificity-pass: Replace generalities with concrete nouns, numbers, names, quotes. 
A Smart Bear

Skeptic-pass: Insert the strongest objection and answer it cleanly (no straw men). 
A Smart Bear

Language-pass: Remove hedges, filler, and throat-clearing. (Cut words; clarity rises.) 
LinkedIn

Flow-pass: Reorder so each paragraph causes the next. If a paragraph could be moved anywhere, it probably belongs nowhere.

Presentation-pass: Title that promises a concrete outcome; subheads that preview payoffs; images/diagrams only when they increase comprehension; produce a print/PDF-friendly version if long. 
@ASmartBear

E. Publish cadence you can keep

Momentum beats inspiration. Keep a small backlog of partially edited drafts to avoid zero weeks.

Say “no” to most tangents; say “yes” when it’s directly on the throughline of what readers return for (focus-without-burnout principle).

4) Test (does it generalize or predict?)

Predictive check: Before publishing, write two predictions your post implies (e.g., “Readers will reply with counterexample X,” or “Founders will quote the specificity line”). If responses match, your mechanism is explanatory, not anecdotal.

Counterexample harvest: When comments or emails provide credible edge-cases, fold them into a future revision/post. The engine learns. (Treat objections as free R&D, not attacks.) 
@ASmartBear

5) Express (jargon-free)

Lead with the concrete problem, not terms of art.

Use plain words. Remove cleverness if it obscures causality.

End with a decision the reader can make today.

Implementation Checklist (repeatable loop)

Capture

 One-sentence claim written up top.

 Named examples you personally witnessed (dates, metrics, decisions).

Build

 Outline: observable → mechanism → implication → objection → resolution.

 Draft in plain text; no CMS until logic locks. 
@ASmartBear

Cut

 Remove everything that doesn’t serve the claim.

 Swap in specifics (numbers/names). 
A Smart Bear

 Add the strongest objection and answer. 
A Smart Bear

 Tighten language (kill filler/hedges). 
LinkedIn

Ship

 Title promises outcome; subheads preview value.

 Longform version offers clean layout & printable PDF when merited. 
@ASmartBear

 Schedule; keep 2–5 drafts in the hopper.

Micro-experiments (to train the muscle)

Specificity drill: Take a 600-word draft. Replace 10 generic phrases with specifics (numbers, named people, timestamps). Measure: does the thesis feel more “inevitable”? 
A Smart Bear

Objection-first draft: Write the best argument against your claim for 10 minutes. Now answer only what survives. 
A Smart Bear

Cut by half: Force a 1,000-word draft to 500 words without losing any step in the logic. Note which cuts improved clarity. 
LinkedIn

Format A/B: Publish a long piece with a print/PDF option; track completion rate and shares versus similar posts without it. 
@ASmartBear

Compression Statement

Write one thing, prove it with specifics, delete everything else.
