Building Nextnest from Scratch: A First-Principles Task Roadmap
Observation: We have a non-technical solo founder aiming to build Nextnest – an AI-driven platform with “AI broker” personas – using Next.js, Chatwoot, BullMQ, and Vercel’s AI agent template. The immediate goal is to reach $10K/month revenue quickly (focus on cash), leveraging “vibe engineering” (AI-assisted coding) since the founder won’t code everything manually. This roadmap outlines the first 100 tasks (beyond basic company registration or simple website setup) needed to build and launch Nextnest from scratch, following a Jason Cohen (WP Engine) style reasoning: start from first principles, focus on real customer value, iterate quickly, and monetize early. We’ll group tasks into phases for clarity, but maintain a continuous numbering to reach 100. Each task is derived logically to ensure we build the right product for a niche audience, deliver value quickly, and learn from real usage.
(Note: “Vibe engineering” refers to using AI tools to write code from natural language descriptions[1], enabling a non-technical founder to implement features by “describing” them to AI.)
Phase 1: Foundation and Strategy (Defining Vision and Niche)
1.	Clarify Nextnest’s Value Proposition: Define in plain terms the core problem Nextnest solves and who has this problem. Identify whether it’s about real estate planning (as the name “Nextnest” suggests a next home or investment) or another scenario-based decision – be as specific as possible about the pain point. This sets the focus for everything that follows.
2.	Identify a Focused Niche and ICP: Choose a niche market and Ideal Customer Profile that Nextnest will serve first. Ensure it’s a segment large enough to get initial users but small enough that big competitors ignore it. For example, if Nextnest is a real estate advisory AI, maybe target first-time homebuyers in a specific city, or property investors in a certain income bracket. Jason Cohen advises startups to carve out a niche where you can win without competing with incumbents – a small startup can succeed with a market that might only generate ~$1M, which large companies wouldn’t bother with[2]. This niche focus will inform product design and marketing language.
3.	Formulate the Core Solution (First Principles): Strip the idea to its primitives – list the minimal inputs and outputs for the solution. For instance, if Nextnest provides scenario analysis for buying a home, the primitives might be: user’s budget, location preferences, financial data (inputs) → recommended options or financial projections (outputs). By understanding the causal mechanics (e.g. how changing a budget impacts the recommendation), you ensure each feature you build ties to a real mechanism or need, not just a “nice-to-have”.
4.	Set a Tangible Success Metric – $10K/month Goal: Establish $10K monthly revenue as the immediate milestone and guiding objective. This isn’t arbitrary – it’s roughly the amount to cover a basic sustainable business (and possibly let the founder go full-time)[3]. Back into this goal by deciding how many customers and at what price will get you there. For example, 150 customers paying ~$66 each yields ~$10K[4]. This will influence pricing strategy (e.g. perhaps a $49/mo and $99/mo tier) and where to focus efforts (high ARPU features to hit revenue with fewer users).
5.	Draft a Lean Strategy (Not Just Goals): Write down a one-page strategy that addresses: Who is the customer? What’s Nextnest’s unique angle? How will we acquire users? This isn’t just a goal like “get X users” – it should outline how to achieve it. Jason Cohen stresses not to confuse goals with strategy[5]. For example, if the strategy is to target first-time homebuyers through a free scenario planning tool and then upsell a paid detailed report, list out those steps. This strategic clarity will guide the task list and help avoid getting sidetracked.
6.	Conduct 5 Customer Discovery Conversations: Reach out to a few potential target users (maybe via personal network or online forums) and talk about their problem. Don’t pitch Nextnest as a finished product – instead, ask how they currently make decisions in the domain (e.g. “How are you planning for buying your next home?”). The goal is to validate that the problem is real and painful. Keep these conversations informal, and listen for what they would pay for. (Be cautious: as Jason notes, pre-product “validation” interviews are useful to disprove ideas, but true validation comes when people actually pay[6]. Still, these talks can ensure you’re not starting off in the wrong direction entirely.)
7.	Distill the MVP Scope: Based on the value proposition and early feedback, decide the minimum viable product features that actually deliver core value. This MVP might include: a web form where users input their scenario details, an instant calculation giving some immediate insight, and a chat interface where an “AI broker” persona provides personalized advice. Exclude any feature that isn’t absolutely necessary to solve the core problem for the niche. Aim for something you can launch quickly and start collecting data from.
8.	Outline “AI Broker” Personas and Roles: Envision a few AI persona types Nextnest will use (e.g. Financial Advisor Alice, Real Estate Agent Bob, or other relevant expert personas). For each, write a short description of their personality, expertise, and how they’ll assist the user. This will guide prompt development later. Keep personas focused on solving the user’s problem – e.g., an AI that’s great at scenario analysis in the chosen domain, providing insights and not just generic advice. (At this stage, it’s an outline; implementation will come later.)
9.	Embrace “Vibe Engineering” Development: Set up your environment for AI-assisted coding. Ensure you have access to tools like OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, or Claude that can help generate code from natural language prompts. Vibe engineering (aka vibe coding) is an AI-assisted development method where you describe your app in plain English and the AI builds it[1]. Concretely, this means preparing a workflow: write clear descriptions of a component or function you need, use the AI to produce code, then test and refine. As a non-technical founder, invest time in learning how to prompt effectively (e.g. “Using Next.js, create a form that does X…”). This approach will speed up development significantly, acting as your “co-engineer.”
10.	Gather Key Resources & Accounts: Before coding, set up all necessary accounts and keys: for example, a Chatwoot account (or self-host it) to get the chat widget code and API keys, an OpenAI API key (or other LLM API) for the AI agent, a Vercel account for hosting (since Next.js will likely be deployed there), and a Redis instance (for BullMQ job queue). Having these ready will smooth the technical setup. Also create a Git repository to manage your code (even if you’re solo, version control is critical).
Phase 2: Technical Setup (Stack Infrastructure & Integrations)
1.	Initiate Next.js Project: Create a new Next.js app (using create-next-app or a starter template). Set it up with TypeScript for safety if possible. Organize the project structure (pages, components) to accommodate the upcoming features (form page, maybe a chat page or integration, etc.). Verify the dev server runs and you can deploy a “Hello World” to Vercel.
2.	Configure Environment Variables: Securely store API keys and connection strings. For example, add environment vars for the Chatwoot token/URL, OpenAI API key, and Redis URL (for BullMQ). This way you can easily use them in code. Ensure you understand how to load these in Next.js (e.g. using .env.local and process.env). This task prevents messy hardcoding and keeps credentials safe.
3.	Integrate Chatwoot Live Chat Widget: Add Chatwoot to the Next.js frontend so users can chat in real-time on your site. Chatwoot provides a script snippet that you include in your app. For Next.js, you can create a simple React component (e.g. <ChatwootWidget/>) that inserts the script on component mount[7]. Use Chatwoot’s documentation to copy the snippet (with your Chatwoot website token and URL) and import this component in your main layout or homepage. After this, a chat bubble should appear on the site, allowing users to send messages[7].
4.	Set Up a Chatwoot Inbox: In your Chatwoot account, create a new inbox for your website (choose “Website” channel). This will generate the website token and snippet you used above. Adjust Chatwoot settings (welcome message, bot name/avatar to match your brand vibe). For now, decide if the inbox will assign conversations to you (the founder) as the agent – since initially you might be personally responding to users via the Chatwoot dashboard. (This is important to capture leads and provide high-touch support early on.)
5.	Plan for Bot Integration (Chatwoot Automation): Research how Chatwoot can integrate with bots or webhooks. Chatwoot supports a bot via their API – e.g., you can configure a bot agent that forwards user messages to your backend and returns an AI answer. Draft how this will work: user sends message -> Chatwoot triggers a webhook -> your Nextnest server receives it, processes with an AI persona, sends reply via Chatwoot API. Note that initially you might not automate fully; as Jason Cohen suggests, it’s fine to do things manually that don’t scale at first[8]. But sketching this out now means you can implement basic automation and know where the human handoff is.
6.	Install and Configure BullMQ (Job Queue): Introduce BullMQ into the project to handle background jobs and scheduling. BullMQ is a Node.js library for creating background job queues, backed by Redis[9]. Install the package (yarn add bullmq ioredis). Connect it to your Redis instance (configure the connection in code)[10]. Create a basic Queue for “scenarioAnalysis” or similar, and a corresponding Worker that will later process those jobs. This lays the groundwork for offloading heavy tasks (like complex calculations or long-running AI calls) so they don’t block user interactions.
7.	Implement a Simple Background Job Example: As a test, write a small job producer and processor using BullMQ. For example, when a form is submitted (we’ll build the form soon), enqueue a job with the scenario data. In the worker, for now just log “Processing scenario for [user]”. This will verify that BullMQ is correctly set up to add and process jobs. You can refine the worker logic later to do actual computation. The key is confirming that the queue works and you know how to monitor it (BullMQ has events for completed/failed jobs).
8.	Integrate Vercel AI Agent Template: Next, incorporate the Vercel AI agent template into your project. This might involve copying in template files or using it as a reference. Ensure you have the LangChain or Vercel AI SDK pieces installed if the template requires them[11]. The template likely provides an example agent that can perform tool usage (search, calculator, etc.). Deploy the basic template and test it locally to ensure it can stream responses from the AI. This step gives you a starting point for building your AI broker logic without reinventing the wheel.
9.	Connect AI Agent to LLM Provider: Configure the AI agent to use your chosen large language model (OpenAI GPT-4, etc.). Insert your API key and test a simple query to ensure the pipeline is working (e.g., ask the agent a basic question and get a response). If the template uses environment variables for model endpoints or keys, make sure those are set. This step ensures the AI “brain” is wired up. Keep the scope small initially – a single-turn Q&A agent is fine to start.
10.	Establish Dev/Test Workflow: Before diving into feature coding, set up a smooth process for developing and testing. This includes running the Next.js dev server, perhaps a separate Node process for BullMQ worker (if needed), and having a way to inspect logs (for chat messages or job outputs). Also, configure GitHub (or GitLab) for code backups, and optionally set up deployment pipeline on Vercel for preview/staging deployments. This prep work will catch environment issues early.
(At this point, the core infrastructure is in place: Next.js app, live chat widget integrated, an AI agent wired up, and a background job system ready. Now we move to building actual features.)
Phase 3: MVP Feature Development (Building Core Features)
1.	Build the Scenario Input Form (Front-end): Create the main form where users enter details for their scenario. This might be a multi-field form asking for relevant info (e.g., if Nextnest is about property investing: fields for budget, location, income, risk tolerance, etc.). Keep it as short as possible while capturing essentials – long forms deter users. Use Next.js pages or a React component for this form. Make sure to handle state for each input and validate basic constraints (like numbers where numbers are needed).
2.	Implement Instant Calculation Logic: If you promised an “instant calc” (perhaps a quick calculation or estimate shown immediately upon filling the form), implement that now. For example, if the user inputs budget and other financials, maybe instantly show an estimate of “maximum property price you can afford” or a simple metric. This could be done right in the browser for speed. Write a small function to perform this calc (e.g., multiply monthly saving by 12 * number of years for down payment, etc., depending on the domain logic). Test with sample inputs to ensure it’s giving plausible results. The goal is to give immediate value with minimal wait, hooking the user’s interest.
3.	Set Up Form Submission Handling: When the user submits the scenario form (clicks submit), determine what happens: likely, you will create a BullMQ job to process a more detailed analysis in the background, and possibly also initiate a chat session or response. Implement the form’s onSubmit to: (a) call a Next.js API route (e.g. /api/submitScenario) or directly server action, which enqueues a job to BullMQ with the scenario data, and (b) navigate the user to a “thank you” or “chat” page where they can see progress or interact further. Ensure you capture the user’s contact info if appropriate (maybe an email field in the form) so you can follow up – this ties into lead generation.
4.	Configure the Scenario Analysis Job (Back-end): In the BullMQ worker, flesh out the job processing logic for “scenarioAnalysis”. At MVP stage, this could be relatively simple: e.g., assemble the input data into a summary, maybe call the AI agent to get a more nuanced analysis or recommendation based on the inputs. For instance, have the AI agent persona “Financial Advisor” take the form inputs and return a paragraph of advice. (Later, this could become more sophisticated or use external data.) The point is to automate something useful after form submission. If the analysis is quick, you might not even need a queued job – but using BullMQ allows scaling later, and you can always have the job complete near-instantly for now.
5.	Return Results to the User: Decide how the user receives the outcome of their scenario submission. Two possibilities: (a) Synchronous – after submission, show a results page with the analysis (if the job is done quickly within a few seconds); or (b) Asynchronous – perhaps inform the user “We’re analyzing your scenario, we’ll be in touch via chat or email soon.” For MVP, synchronous feedback is more impressive, but if it’s complex, asynchronous might be okay. Implement the chosen approach. For synchronous, you can await the BullMQ job (or skip the queue and call the analysis function directly for now) and then display results on a new page. For async, integrate with Chatwoot or email: e.g., have the worker push the results as a message into the Chatwoot conversation or send an email.
6.	Develop AI Broker Persona Responses: Start coding the logic for the AI broker personas in the application. This might involve prompt engineering. For example, create a prompt template for “AI Broker Alice” like: “You are a helpful AI real estate broker. The user’s scenario: {details}. Provide insight and next steps in a friendly, expert tone.” Use the Vercel AI agent (LangChain) to fill in this template with the user’s form inputs or chat question. At first, one well-defined persona is enough. The key is the AI’s output should feel specialized and valuable, not generic ChatGPT. Iterate on the prompt with a few tests (try some sample scenarios and see if the answer sounds like a credible broker/advisor).
7.	Integrate AI with Chatwoot (Bot Mode): Now link the AI persona to the Chatwoot chat, so users can converse with the AI broker in chat. Utilize Chatwoot’s bot integration: when a user sends a message, have Chatwoot call a webhook (your Next.js API route). Implement that route to take the message, call your AI agent with the appropriate persona prompt, and then respond via Chatwoot’s API. Essentially, you’re wiring the Chatwoot conversation to your AI backend. (Refer to Chatwoot docs on setting up an “agent bot” or webhook integration to guide exact steps.) Test this integration: when you type “Hello, I need help with X” in the widget, does your bot respond with something coherent? This is complex, so take it step by step and log everything for debugging.
8.	Create a Basic Knowledge Base (if needed): If Nextnest’s value proposition involves specific data (market data, financial rates, etc.), now is a good time to include a static knowledge base or constants the AI can use. For example, maybe a JSON of current interest rates or a list of average property yields. This can be used in analysis calculations or even fed into the prompt for context. Keep it simple and hard-code small data for now (later you might integrate real APIs). The idea is to give the AI some grounding in facts relevant to the domain so its advice is accurate.
9.	Database Setup for Persistence: Add a database or simple storage mechanism to save important data: user submissions, chat logs, and any lead info. This can be as straightforward as using SQLite or PostgreSQL (perhaps via a service like Supabase or Vercel’s Postgres) – or even a low-code solution like NocoDB if you want quick setup. At minimum, create a table or collection for scenarios (with fields: id, timestamp, user info, scenario details, AI result, etc.) and for chat transcripts (conversation logs). This ensures you are collecting data for later analysis, which was a key goal (logs first, analysis later). It’s fine if some data also lives in Chatwoot; having your own copy helps for flexibility (e.g., if you want to train models on it later).
10.	Implement Logging of User Interactions: Wherever a user interacts (submits form, asks the chat something, receives a response), log it to the database from the previous step. This could be done in the API routes: after you handle a form submission, insert a record of it; after the AI responds via chat, save the Q&A pair to the transcript DB. Ensure that any personally identifiable info is handled carefully – you might anonymize data if analyzing it broadly, but since this is internal for now, just ensure it’s stored securely. These logs are crucial assets: they will allow you to refine the product based on real behavior and later perform the promised scenario analysis improvements with actual usage data.
11.	Design the User Experience Flow: Step back and experience the product as a user would. The flow might be: user lands on site -> sees value proposition -> fills form -> gets immediate calc -> enters chat for deeper discussion with AI broker -> possibly gets a more detailed follow-up (report or email). Make sure this flow is smooth. For instance, after form submit, maybe automatically open the chat widget saying “Your AI broker is ready to discuss your results!” or display a link/button to start chat. Design small UI cues (loading spinners, progress bars, or simple messages like “Analyzing...”) to make the user comfortable during any waits. A polished flow even in MVP keeps users engaged.
12.	Apply Consistent “Vibe” in UI and Messaging: Since we are “vibe-engineering,” ensure the tone and design of Nextnest feels coherent. Choose a simple theme (colors, font) for the Next.js site that matches the persona (e.g., trustworthy and modern for financial advice, or friendly and casual if targeting a younger audience). Write copy on the form page and landing page that speaks in the voice of your brand (maybe Jason Cohen’s observer style: clear and no-nonsense). If you have an AI broker persona, maybe give them a name and have the chat reflect that (e.g., “You are now chatting with Alex, the Nextnest AI Advisor”). These touches will set a professional vibe even if the product is new.
13.	Test the Entire Form-to-Chat Pipeline: Do a dry run of the full MVP functionality as if you’re a user: fill in the scenario form with sample data, submit it, see the instant calc, then go to chat, ask a follow-up question, get an AI response. Check for any broken pieces. For example, did the BullMQ job run and produce a result? Did the result make it back to the user (either displayed on result page or via the chat)? Did the chat AI respond with context? Monitor the browser console and server logs for errors. This end-to-end test will surface integration issues that need fixing before real users try it.
14.	Fix Critical Bugs and UX Issues: It’s almost guaranteed that the first end-to-end test reveals some bugs or awkward UX. Maybe the chat reply was delayed or the form validation failed for a certain input. Gather all these issues and address them one by one. Prioritize anything that blocks the user from completing the flow or that produces obviously wrong outputs. For example, if the AI gave a nonsense answer because it lacked context, improve the prompt. Or if form submission took too long, see if you need to optimize or provide a better loading indicator. Aim to reach a point where a user can go through the core scenario analysis without confusion or errors.
15.	Ensure Basic Security and Privacy Measures: Even in an MVP, don’t ignore user trust. If you’re collecting emails or financial info, put at least a basic privacy policy or note (“We won’t share your data. Your inputs may be used to improve the AI.”). Ensure API routes are not exposing keys (use server-side securely). Implement form validation to prevent injection attacks (Next.js API is pretty safe by default, but be mindful if directly using user input in any eval or query). Also, rate-limit or captcha protect the form if it could be spammed. These tasks prevent future headaches and show professionalism from the start.
Phase 4: Testing & Iteration (Refine Through Feedback Loops)
1.	Invite a Few Friendly Testers: Before a public launch, get 2-3 people (friends or target users from earlier conversations) to try Nextnest. Observe them (remotely or ask them to narrate) as they use it. Where do they stumble? What do they find valuable or confusing? Encourage honest feedback. Since this is a complex AI product, pay attention to whether they trust the AI’s output – trust is key in financial or personal decisions. This small alpha test will give you invaluable insight with minimal risk.
2.	Collect Feedback and Prioritize Changes: Write down all feedback from testers. They might say things like “The form asked for X but I didn’t know what to input” or “The chat reply was too generic.” Look for patterns or high-impact issues. For each piece of feedback, decide if it’s a must-fix before launch or something to improve later. Prioritize issues that affect core value delivery – e.g., if a user didn’t get how to interpret the instant calc, you need to clarify that now. On the other hand, a suggestion like “add feature Y” can go to a backlog. Update the tasks or Trello board accordingly to address critical items first.
3.	Iterate on AI Prompting: If testers found the AI broker’s answers unhelpful or off-mark, refine the prompts or agent chain. This might involve giving the AI more context or constraints. For example, add instructions like “If the user asks for something out of scope, politely guide them back.” Or incorporate any domain info you have: “Based on internal data [X], prioritize suggestions that match user’s budget.” Test the new prompts with a variety of sample questions (including edge cases testers tried) to see if answers improve. This is an ongoing loop – even post-launch you’ll be tweaking the AI to sound more expert and aligned with user needs.
4.	Optimize Performance (Perceived & Actual): Check how fast the app feels. If the chat responses are slow due to the AI call, consider enabling streaming responses (if using OpenAI GPT-4 with streaming via SSE, for instance, the Vercel AI SDK can handle that to show partial responses). If the form analysis is slow, ensure BullMQ isn’t adding unnecessary overhead – maybe process inline for now if it’s small. Also consider load times: optimize images or scripts (the Chatwoot widget loading, etc.). A snappy experience, especially in early stages, will impress users and keep them engaged.
5.	Validate Data Logging & Monitoring: Verify that your logging of chats and form inputs is working correctly. Go to your database or logs and see if the test interactions were saved. You should see records of what testers entered and what the AI replied. Also set up a basic monitoring/alert for your systems – for example, if the BullMQ worker crashes or if an exception occurs in the AI agent, have it log visibly or even email you. As a solo founder, you’ll rely on these logs to catch issues early. Being proactive here means when real users are on the system, you won’t miss something critical.
6.	Stay “Hands-On” with Early Users: Plan how you will manage the initial user interactions personally. Jason Cohen emphasizes that founders doing support themselves in early days is hugely beneficial[8]. So even if the AI is in play, be ready to jump into the Chatwoot conversations live. For instance, if the AI gives a weak answer or the user seems unsatisfied, you (the human) can seamlessly take over the chat in Chatwoot. This high-touch approach not only prevents user frustration but teaches you exactly where the AI or product isn’t meeting expectations. Essentially, you’re using yourself as the ultimate fallback to ensure no early user has a bad experience.
7.	Implement Quick Wins and Polishing: With feedback in and some data, identify a few quick wins – small changes that greatly improve UX or value. For example, maybe adding a tooltip explanation next to a form field, or pre-populating an example scenario to guide new users. These typically don’t take long to code (especially with AI coding help) but can make the product feel more complete. Do a sweep through the UI text as well – ensure it’s friendly and clear (no lorem ipsum or placeholders left). The difference between a rough MVP and a user-friendly product often lies in these little details.
8.	Re-test After Iterations: Run through the entire flow again after making changes, ideally with one of the same testers to see if their experience improves. Make sure no new bugs were introduced. This is essentially a mini-regression test of core functionalities. If possible, have different devices/browsers tested too (e.g., mobile view for the site and chat). By the end of Phase 4, you want confidence that a stranger using Nextnest will understand it, get value, and not encounter a glaring bug.
9.	Prepare Support Materials: Create a basic FAQ or help doc addressing things testers asked. Even a single “Getting Started” page or a few FAQs like “What scenarios can Nextnest analyze?” and “How does the AI work?” can help build trust. You might incorporate this into the chat greeting (e.g., “Hi, I’m Alex, I can help with X, Y, Z.”) or have a link on the site. As a solo founder, a lot of support will be manual, but a little self-service info can reduce repetitive questions and show users that you’re transparent about what the product can/can’t do.
10.	Set a Launch Date and Criteria: Decide when you’re ready to soft-launch to a broader audience. It could be after a certain date or after certain tasks (e.g., once at least 5 users have gone through end-to-end successfully, or after implementing a must-have feature that was missing). Having a target launch date (even if just internal) creates urgency and helps avoid endless tweaking. Make sure you’ve got at least the minimum viable quality by this point: the product doesn’t need to be perfect, but it should reliably do what you claim it does for the niche you chose.
Phase 5: Launch and Early Traction
1.	Launch a Simple Landing Page: If not already done, ensure your marketing landing page is up at your main domain. It should clearly communicate the value proposition to your niche in one headline and a few bullet points. For example: “Nextnest – Plan Your Next Home Purchase with AI. Chat with an AI-powered broker and get instant insights for your home-buying scenario.” Emphasize any immediate benefit (like “Find out how much home you can afford in seconds” or “Get a personalized plan from an AI broker”). Keep it focused on the problem/solution for that niche. Include a prominent call-to-action button (“Start Your Free Scenario Analysis” or “Chat with the AI Broker Now”).
2.	Set Up Initial Call-to-Action Flow: Determine what action you want new visitors to take. It could be starting the scenario form, or initiating a chat, or signing up with email. Make that the central CTA. For instance, the homepage might have a short form right there or a “Get Started” that jumps to the scenario form page. If you prefer capturing leads, maybe “Enter your email to begin” (but note this can add friction – perhaps allow use without signup initially to reduce barriers, but have an email field in the form). Whatever it is, ensure the path from landing to using the product is frictionless and obvious.
3.	Announce on Relevant Platforms: Share your product with the world in places where your target users hang out. This could include posting on a forum or community (e.g., a subreddit for first-time homebuyers, or a personal finance forum) describing the problem it solves. If appropriate, post on Product Hunt or Hacker News – but only if the audience matches; those can give exposure, though not all leads are your target. Even a thoughtful LinkedIn or Twitter thread (if you have industry followers) can help. Be genuine: explain you built Nextnest to solve X problem and you’re looking for feedback from early users. This scrappy outreach is how you get the first few dozen users without a marketing budget.
4.	Leverage Personal Network: Personally reach out (via email or message) to any contacts who might benefit or know someone who would. Early traction often comes from leveraging who you know. Don’t spam – but a personal note like “Hey, I started a new tool for [problem]. If you know anyone struggling with [problem], I’d love if you share this, or I’m happy to personally demo it.” People who respect Jason Cohen’s work or your professional contacts might be intrigued to help or try it. Each personal touch can lead to a user or insightful feedback.
5.	Hustle for the First 10–20 Users: Be prepared that initial user acquisition is manual and requires “hustling” (in Jason’s terms, “scratching and clawing” for the first 150 customers[12]). This might mean spending a couple of weeks very actively promoting, answering questions, offering one-on-one help. For example, if someone shows interest, offer to walk them through a scenario on a call (which also helps you learn). These users won’t just fall in your lap; you’ll earn them through persistence and personal effort at the start.
6.	Onboard New Users Manually: When new users sign up or start using Nextnest, follow up individually. For instance, if someone submits the form, you (as the founder) might personally review their scenario results and send a personalized email like “Hi, I saw you used Nextnest for [scenario]. I’m the founder – let me know if the insights made sense or if you have questions.” This level of attention delights early users. It’s the principle of unparalleled service by founders[8] – something a startup can do that big companies can’t, and it often converts curious users into paying customers or evangelists.
7.	Monitor Usage and Behavior: With real users on, keep a close eye on your analytics and logs. See how many people start the form vs. complete it, how many engage in chat, where they drop off. Also watch the Chatwoot live feed – you might catch users struggling or asking things the AI can’t handle. If you see someone stuck, proactively jump in via Chatwoot as a human agent (“Hey, I’m a human here, saw you had a tough question – let me help”). This not only saves that user’s experience but teaches you what needs improvement. It’s like having a real-time focus group.
8.	Capture Testimonials & Success Stories: As soon as you have users who found Nextnest helpful, ask for a short testimonial or quote. For example, if a user says “Wow, Nextnest showed me I could afford 20% more house than I thought, super helpful!”, ask if you can quote them (with name or anonymously). Place a couple of these on your landing page or share them in marketing. Social proof early on builds credibility. Even feedback like “I love the concept, if it could also do X I’d pay for it” is useful – it shows both interest and gives direction.
9.	Iteratively Improve Onboarding: Based on where users struggled, tweak the onboarding process. This could mean adding a one-time tutorial pop-up, or simplifying the form further if many quit halfway. Perhaps some users didn’t realize there’s a chat after the form – so maybe automatically open the chat with a welcome message like “Hi, I’ve analyzed your data, ask me anything about it!” to prompt engagement. Each small fix can lift conversion rates and user satisfaction. Do these tweaks quickly as you spot issues, since in early days, every user’s experience counts enormously.
10.	Track Key Early Metrics: Set up a simple dashboard (even a Google Sheet manually updated) for key metrics: number of form submissions per day, number of chat conversations, conversion to any sign-up or payment, etc. Seeing these numbers will help you understand if your outreach is working and how users are flowing through. For example, if many fill the form but few use chat, you may have an engagement drop-off. If lots of chats but no one pays for anything, maybe the free part is great but the paid offering isn’t clear or compelling. Use these metrics to guide next steps, but remember at small scale, individual user feedback is even more important than numbers.
Phase 6: Monetization (Turning Usage into Revenue)
1.	Identify the Core Monetizable Value: Analyze what aspect of Nextnest users are finding most valuable. Is it the personalized advice from the AI broker? The detailed scenario report? The convenience of quick answers? Pinpoint something that users would likely pay for because it saves or makes them money (or time). For instance, maybe the free version gives a basic analysis, and users might pay for a more comprehensive report or a one-on-one consultation (even if powered by AI). Solidify the hypothesis: “Users will pay for X”.
2.	Define Pricing Strategy & ARPU Target: Decide on a pricing model that aligns with your $10K/month goal. Jason Cohen suggests bootstrappers should be obsessed with ARPU to reach sustainable revenue[3]. For example, if you aim for ~$50–$100/month per customer, you only need ~100-200 customers for $10K MRR[4]. Consider whether to offer a monthly subscription (e.g., $79/mo for ongoing access to the AI broker and premium features), or one-off fees (e.g., $199 for a detailed personalized plan). You could also have tiers – maybe a free tier (limited features), a self-serve paid tier, and a higher tier with some human expert review. Choose an approach that fits the nature of the service and the niche’s willingness to pay.
3.	Implement Payment Infrastructure: Set up a Stripe account (or alternative like PayPal) to handle payments. For simplicity, you can start with Stripe Checkout or a pre-built payment page – you don’t need full in-app subscription management from day one. Add a pricing page on the site that lists your offering(s) and a “Buy” button. Integrate Stripe Checkout to securely collect payment and, upon success, trigger whatever access or service corresponds to the purchase. For example, if it’s a subscription, create a basic mechanism to mark users as premium (even a manual list or a flag in DB). Test the payment flow in test mode, then live with a small transaction to ensure it works end-to-end (taking a payment, you getting the money, and the user getting acknowledged).
4.	Monetization Feature Gating: Modify the product to delineate free vs paid features. For instance, allow the initial scenario analysis and maybe a few AI chat questions for free, but require an upgrade for extended conversation or a downloadable in-depth report. You might implement a simple check like: after 5 chat exchanges, the bot says “To dive deeper with personalized advice, please upgrade” along with a link. Or blur out part of the analysis result pending payment. Be transparent and not too aggressive, but do let users know there’s more value if they pay. This step is critical to actually converting usage into revenue.
5.	Offer a “Concierge MVP” Paid Service: To get the first paying customers, you might offer a high-touch service leveraging Nextnest. For example, a paid package where after using the AI, the founder will personally review the scenario and provide additional insights or a custom report. Essentially, you sell your time/expertise on top of the AI for a premium (say $500 one-time or similar). This concierge MVP approach means you’re monetizing even before full product maturity by doing things manually that clients value. It’s also a great way to learn what premium features people want. Make sure to only promise what you can deliver, but this can jumpstart revenue and test price sensitivity.
6.	First Paid Customer Acquisition: Proactively reach out to some engaged users to upsell. When you identify a user who clearly has a strong need (e.g., they’ve used the chat extensively or expressed a big goal), send a personalized note offering the premium service or subscription. Explain the added benefits succinctly and perhaps offer a time-limited discount since they’re an early user. Often, those first few customers come from direct conversations rather than a self-serve checkout. Don’t be shy – if you believe your product can genuinely help them save or make money, it’s a win-win to ask for a reasonable payment in return for even more value.
7.	Monetization Feedback Loop: Once someone converts to paid, follow up closely on their experience. Treat them like a VIP. Did they get the value they hoped for? What could be improved for paying users? Their feedback will be especially important to refine your paid offering. Also, monitor usage differences: paying users might engage more – ensure your system can handle that (e.g., if they can ask unlimited questions, can your AI costs and infrastructure support a power user?). This might lead to adjustments in pricing or limits (for instance, “up to 50 questions a month” if needed to control costs).
8.	Annual Plans for Cashflow (Optional): If you decide on a subscription model, consider offering an annual payment option at a discount. As Jason notes, annual plans boost cash flow significantly – even if only a portion take it, it can triple monthly cash in the bank[13]. For example, offer 2 months free (pay $790 for a year instead of $948). Early on, cash is king, so even a few annual pre-pays can fund further development. Add this option to your pricing page if applicable, and perhaps mention it to prospects (“you can save X% by paying annually”).
9.	Instrument Revenue Tracking: Set up a simple way to track revenue: even a spreadsheet where you log each sale or subscription start. Later you can automate this, but you want to know exactly how close you’re getting to that $10K goal. Track metrics like Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), number of paying users, Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), etc. For now it might be tiny numbers, but establishing the habit of metrics-tracking will help you iterate on business model. If you notice ARPU is low or churn is high, you can react early.
10.	Guardrail for AI Usage Costs: Since AI API calls (OpenAI, etc.) cost money, implement some basic monitoring on those costs relative to revenue. At this stage, it’s fine if you’re spending more on AI than revenue (that’s like an investment in learning), but you should know if, say, one heavy user is going to incur $50 of AI calls while paying $20. If necessary, tweak your usage limits or pricing to ensure unit economics can make sense in the long run. This could be as simple as an internal note like “free tier limited to X interactions” or optimizing prompts to reduce tokens. It’s easier to adjust now than after scaling to many users.
Phase 7: Data Analysis and Learning (Using Collected Data)
1.	Begin Aggregating Usage Data: With a growing pool of chat logs and scenario submissions, start periodically reviewing this data for insights. For example, gather the most common questions users ask the AI broker, or the most frequent scenario parameters (maybe most users are putting “budget $500k” or similar). This helps understand your user base’s profile and needs. Use simple analysis – export logs and read through them, or use a script to count frequencies. No heavy ML needed yet; just get a qualitative and quantitative sense of patterns.
2.	Evaluate AI Performance: Look at conversation histories where the AI struggled. Identify failure modes (e.g., giving irrelevant answers, needing the founder to intervene, etc.). This analysis will guide where to improve the AI. It might reveal that users often ask for advice in areas your AI isn’t trained or allowed (like legal or something). Armed with this info, plan either to expand the AI’s knowledge base, adjust prompts, or explicitly communicate limitations to users. The goal is to continuously narrow the gap between what users want and what the AI delivers.
3.	Analyze Funnel Metrics: Examine each stage of the user funnel using the data: visits -> form start -> form complete -> chat engaged -> attempted to upgrade -> paid. See where the biggest drop-offs are. For instance, if many start the form but few finish, maybe the form is too long or intimidating. If many use the free chat but few pay, maybe the paid value proposition isn’t hitting. Use data to form a hypothesis for each drop-off and consider experiments to fix them (shorter form, different messaging for upgrade, etc.). Essentially, turn data into actionable tasks for improvement.
4.	User Segmentation: Try to segment your users into a few buckets based on behavior or attributes. Perhaps you find two main groups: e.g., Group A – younger first-time buyers asking basic questions, and Group B – seasoned investors asking technical financial questions. Segmentation can help tailor your product: you might decide to focus on one group if they’re more likely to pay or have a higher need. Or you might create two different experiences or persona modes to better serve each. Data like chat content and scenario details will inform these personas (which ironically are your users’ personas, not the AI’s).
5.	Validate or Refine Value Proposition: Compare the problems users actually discuss vs. what you thought was the main value proposition. Maybe you pitched “plan your next home purchase” but many users end up asking about refinancing or renting vs buying. If there’s a mismatch, you may need to adjust your messaging (and eventually your product focus) to fit the real use-cases emerging. It’s fine if the product evolves – many startups pivot or refine their proposition when they see how users actually use it. Use the data to ensure you’re solving a real and important problem, not just the one you imagined.
6.	Plan Data-Driven Improvements: Create a list of improvements or new features grounded in the data analysis. For example, if 30% of users ask “Can you forecast my mortgage payments?”, that feature might be worth building. Rank these by how much they would improve user experience or increase the likelihood of payment. This becomes your roadmap 2.0. Keep Jason Cohen’s advice in mind: focus on what your own users are telling you and don’t get distracted by what competitors might be doing[14]. Your early data is gold for steering the product.
7.	Check for Missed Monetization Opportunities: Analyze if some users dropped off right when a paywall hit – did they balk at price, or did they even see the offer? Perhaps your data shows many users have long chats but never hit the upgrade prompt because they stay within free limits. This could indicate you should adjust the free/paid threshold to prompt earlier, or improve how you communicate the premium value. Alternatively, maybe some users went to the pricing page but didn’t convert – consider reaching out to them (if you have email) to ask why, or try an exit survey. Data can highlight these opportunities to capture value that’s currently slipping away.
8.	Maintain Data Hygiene and Ethics: As you collect more user data, implement proper measures to respect privacy. If you haven’t yet, now’s a good time to add a privacy policy on your site explicitly stating what data you collect and how it’s used. Also, consider if you need to anonymize data when analyzing (especially if you plan to use it to train any model). Delete any truly sensitive info that isn’t needed. Ethically handling user data builds trust and also prevents future legal hassles. This task might involve consulting documentation or guidelines for data protection relevant to your region (GDPR if Europe, etc.).
9.	Monitor System Scalability via Data: Keep an eye on how the system is holding up with more data and usage. Check your database growth – are queries still fast? Is Chatwoot handling the volume of chats? Monitor the queue – any backlog forming? This isn’t scaling to thousands yet, but you want to catch any bottleneck early. For instance, if each new user’s data significantly increases an AI processing time (maybe a complexity issue), plan to optimize that. Essentially, use your data to foresee scaling issues before they become fires.
10.	Revisit Your $10K Revenue Plan: With actual numbers now, recalc what it takes to hit $10K MRR. For example, if your ARPU turned out to be $30 instead of $60, you’ll need more customers – does that seem feasible given your conversion rates? Or maybe you find some people are ready to pay more for extra services – could you increase ARPU? Adjust your pricing or user acquisition strategies based on what the data is telling you. This might involve upping marketing efforts or tweaking the offering to raise the average revenue per user. Always tie it back: we want a path to $10K that is backed by evidence from our early traction.
Phase 8: Continuous Improvement (Product and Tech Enhancements)
1.	Develop the Most-Requested Feature: Take the top item from your data-driven improvements list (from task 71) and implement it. For instance, if users repeatedly ask the AI something it can’t handle well, build a feature for that. This could be adding a new tool to the AI agent (e.g., a calculator or access to an external API for live data) to extend its capabilities. Or it might be a UI feature like a comparison chart output. Use your AI coding assistants to speed up development – describe the feature clearly and have them generate the code, then refine. After building, test it thoroughly (especially if it involves new data sources or APIs). Announce this improvement to your users, as it can re-engage folks who asked for it.
2.	Enhance AI Model or Integration: As usage grows, consider if your AI needs upgrading. This could mean fine-tuning a model on your domain data (if you have enough logs, you can train a custom model or at least fine-tune GPT on your specific Q&A pairs). Alternatively, explore using a more specialized model if available (maybe a finance-specific LLM if Nextnest is finance-heavy). Also, possibly incorporate a retrieval augmented generation approach: e.g., store a vector index of past Q&As or external knowledge, so the AI can pull relevant info for each query. These steps can significantly boost answer quality and differentiation of your AI broker from general AI. They are technical but worthwhile once you have sufficient data and revenue to justify the effort.
3.	Improve the UI/UX Design: Around this time, it’s good to uplift the overall design from MVP scrappiness to a more professional look. Maybe involve a designer friend or use a modern Next.js UI kit (Tailwind UI, Chakra UI, etc.) to refine the interface. Focus on clarity and ease of use: for example, a cleaner layout for the results page, nicer formatting of AI responses (maybe chat bubbles, or highlighting key numbers), and a responsive mobile design if not already. A polished UI can increase user trust – important as you start charging money. Don’t go overboard with cosmetics, but fix any “rough edges” that might make the product seem amateur.
4.	Automate Repetitive Tasks: As a solo operator, notice if there are any tasks you keep doing manually that could be automated. For instance, are you manually emailing each user their report? If so, build that into the system (when analysis is done, auto-email the user with results). Or if you’re manually checking logs for errors, perhaps set up an alert system. Using BullMQ and other tools, you can schedule jobs for routine things (like sending weekly summary to users, or cleaning up old data). Automation will free your time as you get more users, and reduce the chance of human error or delay.
5.	Strengthen the Backend for Scale: By now you might have enough usage to justify hardening the backend. This includes: migrating from any “quick and dirty” implementations to more robust ones. For example, if you used an in-memory store or SQLite for speed, move to a proper scalable DB. If your API routes are getting heavy use, consider splitting services (maybe separate the AI processing server from the Next.js frontend). Also implement backups for your data – ensure you won’t lose the accumulated valuable data (regular DB dumps or using a managed DB that handles backups). This task is about ensuring the tech won’t crumble as you acquire the next 100, 500, 1000 users.
6.	Customer Support Processes: As support load grows, formalize it a bit. You might integrate Chatwoot with your email or Slack to get notifications, or set up saved replies in Chatwoot for common questions. If you find yourself answering the same question multiple times, maybe add it to an FAQ or create a quick tutorial video. Also consider the hours you cover support – if users are global, manage expectations by indicating support hours or implementing a chatbot response off-hours that says “We’ll get back to you soon.” Great support is still a key advantage, but you can streamline it with some preparation.
7.	Community or User Engagement: Think about building a community around Nextnest’s niche. Perhaps start a Discord or a forum for users to discuss their scenarios or share experiences. This can increase engagement and provide peer-to-peer support, taking some load off you. It also provides more user insight. If you go this route, seed the community with interesting topics or your own tips/tricks. Alternatively, a simpler engagement might be sending a monthly newsletter with tips and updates (which also reminds users of the value they get). Keeping users engaged beyond the initial use will help with retention and word-of-mouth growth.
8.	Explore Partnerships: Identify any potential partners or channels that could accelerate growth. For example, if Nextnest is for home buying, maybe partner with a mortgage broker or realtor network – they could refer clients to your tool (as it helps clients prepare) and you might refer users to them when they’re ready to act. Or if there’s a popular blog or YouTube channel in your niche, reach out for a collaboration (like they review or mention Nextnest, or you write a guest post). Partnerships can give you exposure to a larger relevant audience without huge marketing spend. Start with informal chats to gauge interest.
9.	Watch Competitors & Differentiators: While focusing on your users is #1, stay aware of any competitors in this space. If new AI tools for scenario analysis pop up, sign up and see what they do. Jason Cohen mentioned not blindly copying competitors but understanding your own strengths[14]. Use this intelligence to ensure Nextnest stays differentiated. Maybe you double down on a feature others don’t have, or you highlight an aspect (like “human-backed AI advice” if you still do custom help) that sets you apart. Regularly updating your differentiators in marketing will be important as the market evolves.
10.	Iterate on Pricing if Needed: Based on how monetization is going, don’t be afraid to tweak pricing or packaging. Perhaps you discover users would pay more for certain add-ons, or that your price is a bit high for the market and lowering it could yield more volume. By now you have some data on conversion rates – experiment carefully with pricing (maybe offer a limited-time promotion, or A/B test a different price on a subset of new visitors if possible). Also consider simplifying pricing if users seem confused. The aim is to maximize revenue in a way that users feel is fair and a no-brainer for the value they get.
Phase 9: Marketing and Growth Expansion
1.	Double Down on Content Marketing: Content will be a powerful, cost-effective way to attract your target users. Start writing high-value content related to Nextnest’s domain. For instance, blog posts like “5 Tips for First-Time Homebuyers to Save Money” or “Case Study: How AI Helped a Buyer Plan Their Purchase”. Make sure these are genuinely useful, not just salesy, and naturally mention how Nextnest can help. Jason Cohen’s own success with A Smart Bear blog underscores how sharing expertise builds an audience. Publish these on your website and share on social channels or relevant forums. Over time, this can bring steady organic traffic of interested users.
2.	SEO and Keywords: Identify the search queries your potential users might use (e.g., “how much house can I afford calculator” or “AI financial advisor for home buying”). Optimize your content and landing pages for these terms. Ensure your site is indexed, with proper meta tags and fast performance for SEO ranking. You might create dedicated landing pages for specific keywords (“Nextnest – AI Mortgage Planner” if that’s a sub-niche). SEO takes time, but starting now means in a few months you could see significant inbound traffic. Track your search rankings for key terms monthly and refine content accordingly.
3.	Scale Up Advertising (Cautiously): If you have a budget or once you have some revenue, experiment with targeted ads. Google Ads for keywords in your niche or Facebook/Instagram ads targeting the demographic (e.g., 25-35 year olds looking to buy homes) could funnel more users. Start small ($5-$10/day) and measure results. See if the cost per acquisition makes sense relative to your ARPU/LTV. If one channel performs (e.g., Google search ads might catch users actively seeking a calculator or advice), you can increase spend there. Be data-driven – don’t burn money without tracking conversions. The goal is to find one scalable channel that can predictably bring in users at a reasonable cost.
4.	Affiliate or Referral Programs: Consider setting up a referral incentive. Happy early users might refer friends if there’s something in it for them. For example, give a referrer a $20 credit or a free month for each friend who becomes a paying user (and maybe the friend gets a discount too). There are simple SaaS tools to track referrals, or you can do it manually initially (“email us and mention your friend’s email, we’ll apply a credit”). Referral marketing can harness word-of-mouth systematically – especially in personal domains like home buying, people do talk to friends about their plans, so make Nextnest part of that conversation.
5.	Public Relations (PR) Efforts: As you gain success stories or hit milestones, pitch them to media or relevant newsletters. For instance, a local news piece “AI helps Singapore couple buy their first home” (assuming user location from prompt context) can both validate your concept and reach more users. Write a brief press release or founder story and send it to bloggers/journalists in the personal finance or real estate space. Even niche newsletters (like FinTech weekly, or tech blogs) might feature an interesting use-case of AI. PR can bring a burst of users and credibility (people trust something they read in a respected outlet).
6.	Scale Customer Support & Success: With growth, proactively ensure users remain happy. This might mean bringing on help: maybe a part-time support person or a virtual assistant to cover chats during certain hours or handle basic queries. Before that, you could implement an AI-based FAQ bot in Chatwoot to answer common questions instantly. Also, consider a customer success approach for paid users: periodically check in with them, offer tips to get more value, and ensure they are renewing. Keeping churn low is as important as acquiring new users for reaching revenue targets.
7.	Expand Features for New Segments: Once you feel you have solid footing in your initial niche, you could consider adjacent user segments or use-cases. For example, if you started with first-time homebuyers, maybe expand to real estate investors or people looking to refinance. Each expansion should be deliberate: do some research or tests to confirm there’s demand and that your existing platform can be adapted. If proceeding, create tailored experiences or content for that segment (e.g., a version of the form with slightly different questions). This can open new revenue streams, but avoid spreading too thin too fast – ensure the original niche remains well-served.
8.	Keep an Eye on Financials: As the company grows, maintain good financial habits. Track your monthly profit/loss – how much are you spending on hosting, AI API calls, any contractors, vs. revenue. Since the goal is sustainable growth, you might still be reinvesting all revenue into growth, but you don’t want to run out of cash. If expenses start to climb with scale (AI costs, support costs, etc.), plan for how to cover them (e.g., raising prices, or possibly seeking funding if needed). Jason Cohen bootstrapped successfully, emphasizing revenue-funded growth, but he also notes not to undercapitalize if big opportunities require it[15]. For now, likely you remain lean and scrappy, but plan ahead for financial sustainability.
9.	Optionally, Consider Funding or Accelerator: If Nextnest is gaining traction (users love it, revenue climbing), you might face a choice: continue bootstrapped or raise money to scale faster. Jason Cohen has done both bootstrapping and VC routes, and one of his lessons is raising “enough” money if you do raise[15] (ensure runway). Evaluate if external funding (angel or seed round) could significantly speed up reaching a dominant position (e.g., hire a dev team, blitz marketing). If yes, prepare a pitch deck, leveraging your early metrics as proof. Alternatively, you might consider an accelerator program to get mentorship and a seed investment. This is not a task to take lightly – do it if you have a clear use for the money and a path to scale, otherwise continuing to grow via revenues (maybe slower but more under your control) could be wiser.
10.	Scale Infrastructure Proactively: Don’t wait for a crash to scale up your servers and services. If you see user count and data volume rising steadily, upgrade your Vercel plan or move to dedicated Node servers as needed. Scale your database (if using Postgres, maybe move to a larger instance or add read replicas if necessary). Ensure Redis (for BullMQ) has enough memory and persistence mode if needed so you don’t lose jobs. Also, implement monitoring and alerts (services like UptimeRobot or custom scripts) to get notified of downtime or high load. Scaling is often straightforward with cloud services, but doing it a step too late can cause outages which hurt user trust. “Big Rocks” in planning should include capacity for growth[16] – as a startup you can tolerate slower ramp, but availability and reliability must remain solid.
Phase 10: Long-Term Vision and Team (Beyond the First 100 Tasks)
1.	Re-evaluate Vision and Roadmap: At this stage, step back and revisit your long-term vision for Nextnest. Is the original mission (from Task #1) holding true? Maybe you’ve uncovered an even bigger opportunity or a need to pivot slightly. Use everything learned to either double-down on the core idea or adjust course. Update your roadmap for the next phases (maybe tasks 101-200!) focusing on scaling what’s working and cutting what’s not. Having a clear vision helps align any future team members or investors behind the “why” of what you’re doing.
2.	Consider Team Expansion: As a solo founder, reflect on whether it’s time to bring in help for areas you lack or to accelerate progress. According to Jason Cohen, one mistake is thinking you must do every job yourself before hiring[17]. If coding is a bottleneck (despite AI help) or if marketing could use a specialist, hiring might be justified. List the roles or skills that would have the biggest impact (e.g., a full-stack developer to build features faster, or a marketing lead to scale user acquisition). Even an intern or contractor could offload some workload. At ~10k MRR, you may afford a part-time hire. Remember, hiring doesn’t mean losing control; it means freeing yourself to focus on what you do best.
3.	Establish Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): As you prepare to potentially grow the team or just to streamline, document the key processes. Write simple SOPs for things like: How to deploy new code, How to handle a support ticket, How to run the data analysis script, etc. This not only helps if you bring someone on board, but also forces you to make your operations efficient and repeatable. It’s easier to hand off tasks when there’s a clear guide. Start with the tasks you’d delegate first (say support or basic front-end fixes) and create checklists/instructions. This also reduces risk if you are unavailable – your business won’t halt because knowledge is written down.
4.	Stay Customer-Centric: Ensure that even as you scale, you keep close to customer needs. Implement a cadence for yourself (and the team, if any) to regularly engage with users – be it monthly user calls, feedback surveys, or community AMAs. As Jason’s experience shows, maintaining that direct line to customers can inform strategy and build loyalty[8][18]. At 100 customers or 1000, find ways to still hear their voices (maybe use tools like NPS surveys or just schedule a few customer conversations every month). This will prevent you from building features no one asked for and keep your product relevant.
5.	Practice Continuous First-Principles Thinking: Finally, embed the embodied logic mode approach in your ongoing operations. For every new challenge or idea, observe the facts, simplify the problem to fundamentals, rebuild a solution from those basics, test it against reality, and express it clearly. This meta-habit will help you navigate complex decisions without bias or jargon. Whether it’s deciding on a new feature, a marketing campaign, or a pivot, approach it with curiosity and analytical rigor. This way, Nextnest’s growth will be driven by understanding and solving real causes, not by mimicking competitors or chasing hype. In essence: remain the clear-eyed observer of your product’s reality, always ready to iterate.
Compression Principle: Build Nextnest step-by-step by delivering real user value, learning from actual usage, and optimizing for sustainable revenue – every task flows from understanding cause and effect, ensuring each move is deliberate, data-informed, and aligned with solving the core problem.
