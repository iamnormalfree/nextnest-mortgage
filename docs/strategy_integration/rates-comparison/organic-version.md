Love the version you sent—it’s crisp, neutral, and safe. Here’s a first-principles, meta plan to automate this entire advisory + comms flow so you can do it in minutes, consistently, and with audit-proof guardrails.

1) Decompose the job

Inputs

Client: loan_amount, remaining_tenor_months (e.g., 321), current_bank, current_rate_type (e.g., OCBC 3M SORA +0.35), current_instalment, lock-in dates.

Market: 1M/3M SORA prints, per-bank spreads, lock-ins, FC12 rules, conversion rules, legal/valuation subsidies, cash rebates, fixed-rate offers.

Preferences: stability vs savings, sensitivity to monthly volatility, preference for cash buffer today vs lower rate path.

Transformations

Amortisation math (fractional tenor like 26.75 yrs).

“Effective rate” = SORA + spread (by period).

Monthly payment deltas vs baseline.

Interest saved vs staying (not totals)—your chosen metric.

Net cash effect after subsidies/rebates (legal + valuation – rebate).

Qualitative flags: FC12 present?, monthly vs quarterly peg?, fixed flexibility risk?

Outputs

A WhatsApp-ready summary (your tone), with “estimates only” + rounding.

1-page comparison PDF/screenshot per bank (evidence pack).

CRM case note with full math + parameters for auditability.

2) Data model (single source of truth)

Use a small JSON schema you can store in Airtable/DB:

{
  "case_id": "JUSTIN-2025-10-21",
  "loan": { "amount": 1154000, "tenor_months": 321 },
  "baseline": {
    "bank": "OCBC",
    "rate": { "index": "3M_SORA", "index_rate": 0.0139, "spread": 0.0035 },
    "lock_months": 24,
    "instalment_m_est": 4500
  },
  "offers": [
    {
      "bank": "D***S",
      "periods": [
        {"months": 12, "index": "3M_SORA", "index_rate": 0.0139, "spread": 0.0028},
        {"months": 12, "index": "3M_SORA", "index_rate": 0.0139, "spread": 0.0030}
      ],
      "fc12": true, "conversion_anytime": true,
      "rebate_cash": 3000, "legal_fee": 1800, "valuation_fee": 500
    },
    {
      "bank": "S***B",
      "periods": [
        {"months": 24, "index": "1M_SORA", "index_rate": 0.0129, "spread": 0.0030}
      ],
      "fc12": true, "legal_subsidy_cap": 2000, "valuation_subsidy": 500
    }
  ],
  "fixed_reference": [{"bank": "OCBC", "tenor": 24, "fixed_rate": 0.0155}, {"bank":"OCBC","tenor":36,"fixed_rate":0.0155}],
  "assumptions": {"rounding": "nearest_10", "estimates_only": true, "disclaimer_version": "v1.2"}
}

3) Calculator engine (deterministic & auditable)

Implement PMT/interest schedule precisely (monthly compounding, exact months).

Support multi-period rates (e.g., 12 months at 1.67%, then 12 months at 1.69%).

Output:

instalment_m_est (rounded to nearest $10),

interest_saved_vs_baseline_24m,

cashflow_effects: {rebate, subsidies, net_out_of_pocket},

qualitative flags (FC12, peg cadence, volatility note).

Safety rails

Every figure carries .source (e.g., “bank sheet / date / file hash”) + .calc_version.

Emit uncertainty tags if inputs missing (aligns with your Response-Awareness idea), e.g.:

#VERIFY: legal_subsidy_cap missing -> assumed 2000

Always append “illustrative / bank to confirm” disclaimers in outputs.

4) Decision heuristics (explainable, not black-box)

A small rules layer picks the narrative:

If instalment_m_est is lowest by ≥ $50 and FC12=true → “lowest instalment & fastest reaction”.

If quarterly peg and rebate_cash - (legal+valuation) ≥ 500 → “larger cash buffer, steadier peg”.

If client prefers stability or fixed < min(SORA+spread) by ≥ 10 bps → offer neutral fixed-rate paragraph.

Keep it explainable: the message shows the reason (“because X < Y by Z, FC12 present, rebate covers fees”).

5) Message generator (templates, not ad-hoc)

Create two templates:

A) SORA template (your final style)

Hey {{first_name}}!
Quick rate check (estimates only): 1M SORA {{m_sora}} | 3M SORA {{q_sora}}.
Figures rounded; bank schedules will vary slightly.

OCBC repricing – 3M SORA ({{q_sora}}) + 0.35% = {{ocbc_eff}} · 2-yr lock
≈ ${{ocbc_instal_m}}/m est. · No free conversion.
(They also have {{fixed_rate}}% fixed for {{fixed_years}} yrs — lower today, but less flexible if SORA eases.)

D***S – Yr1 3M SORA ({{q_sora}}) + 0.28% = {{dbs_y1_eff}}, Yr2 +0.30% = {{dbs_y2_eff}}
≈ ${{dbs_y1_instal}} → ${{dbs_y2_instal}}/m est. · Saves ≈ ${{dbs_saved}} interest vs OCBC.
~${{dbs_rebate}} rebate covers legal (~${{legal}}) + valuation (~${{valuation}}) with ≈ ${{dbs_surplus}} surplus.
Free conversion anytime.

S***B – 1M SORA ({{m_sora}}) + 0.30% = {{scb_eff}} · 2-yr lock · FC12
≈ ${{scb_instal}}/m est. · Saves ≈ ${{scb_saved}} interest vs OCBC.
Legal + valuation fees covered (caps apply).
1M peg reacts faster; expect monthly movement.

Summary:
• S***B → lowest instalment & fastest reaction
• D***S → steadier quarterly peg & extra cash buffer
• OCBC {{fixed_rate}}% fixed → simpler stay-put, less flexible if rates ease


B) Fixed-rate neutral paragraph

(They also offer fixed at {{fixed_rate}}% for {{fixed_years}} years. That’s lower today, but it won’t step down if SORA falls, so flexibility is limited. Happy to keep it in view if stability is the priority.)

6) Evidence pack (one tap)

Auto-attach the three screenshots (or auto-generated 1-page tables) with headers:

Loan $1,154,000 · Tenor 26.75 yrs · “Estimates only—subject to bank issuance”.

Watermark with timestamp + source to protect you.

7) Workflow wiring (no-code + light code)

Airtable (or Postgres) → stores cases & bank tables.

n8n (or Make) flow:

Intake form (Airtable/GHL/Typeform) → validate.

Fetch current SORA (manual input or API) + bank spreads (from your table).

Run calculator microservice (small Cloud Function in Python/Node).

Write outputs back to case record.

Generate message via template engine (Mustache/Handlebars).

Send via WhatsApp Business API (through GHL/Twilio/360dialog).

Save PDF/screens to GDrive + link into CRM note.

Versioning: calc v, template v, data v per message (for compliance).

8) QA & “can’t blame you” safeguards

Auto-insert disclaimer line every time:

“All figures are rounded estimates for illustration; banks will confirm final numbers.”

Rounding policy: nearest $10 for instalments; nearest $50 for “saves ≈ $X”.

Sanity checks before send:

If savings < $300 over 24m → soften recommendation (“options are close; preference-driven”).

If fixed < floating by ≥ 10–15 bps → include fixed paragraph automatically.

If legal/valuation subsidy caps unknown → inject #VERIFY note and suppress $ amounts.

9) “Explain your answer” (audit trail)

Store a mini rationale record:

rationale: [
  "SCB chosen as ‘lowest instalment’ because 1.59% < 1.67%/1.69% and FC12 present.",
  "DBS highlighted for cash buffer: rebate 3000 – (legal 1800 + val 500) ≈ 700 surplus.",
  "OCBC fixed 1.55% acknowledged due to client’s current bank; framed as less flexible if SORA drops."
]


If questioned later, you can show exact inputs + outputs from that day.

10) “One-tap variants”

A short mode (<900 chars) and a full mode toggle.

A stability-first variant (if client says “I hate volatility”).

An aggressive savings variant (if client optimizes for minimum payment).

What you’ll get from this

Consistency (no hand-tweaking, same tone every time).

Speed (2–3 minutes from intake to WhatsApp).

Safety (estimates + sources + versioning).

Clarity (SORA + spread = effective rate, savings focused).

Scalability (drop in new banks/rules without rewriting prompts).

If you want, I can draft the Airtable fields, the calc function signature, and the n8n nodes map so you can wire it exactly to your stack.
