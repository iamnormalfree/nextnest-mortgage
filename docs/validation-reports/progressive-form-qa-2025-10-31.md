# Progressive Form QA Summary — 2025-10-31

## Test Matrix

| Area | Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calculator | `npm test -- --runInBand` | ✅ Pass (192 tests) |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | ✅ Pass |
| Step 3 Refinance | Component suite with analytics assertions | ✅ Pass |
| Form Config / Schemas | Zod coverage tests | ✅ Pass |

## Manual Verification

- New purchase flow: property categories, optional context toggle, MAS readiness card, employment and liability inputs behave per spec.
- Refinance flow: objective toggles, cash-out gating, timing guidance, and calculator outlook render correctly for owner-occupied and investment cases.
- Deep link `/?loanType=refinance` initializes defaults and analytics without regressions.
- Mobile viewport smoke test confirms segmented controls and cards remain accessible.

## Residual Risks

- Step 3 new purchase panel still shows handcrafted advisory copy; persona-derived reason codes/policy references not yet surfaced (non-blocking, logged for follow-up).
- React Testing Library run surfaces non-breaking warning about controlled inputs when toggling joint applicant income; monitor during future refactors.
