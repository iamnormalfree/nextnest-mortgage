# n8n Webhook Testing Guide - NextNest Lead Forms

## To personally test in Powershell

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://primary-production-1af6.up.railway.app/webhook-test/api/forms/analyze" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"formData":{"email":"test@test.com","loanType":"refinance"}}'


## **Problem Diagnosed & Solved** üéâ

### **What Was Causing the Testing Issues:**

1. **‚ùå "Authorization data is wrong!"** 
   - **Root Cause**: n8n webhook was in **TEST MODE**
   - **Symptom**: Railway returned 403 Forbidden with auth error
   - **Reality**: Not an auth issue, but webhook not activated

2. **‚ùå Webhook Not Registered Error**
   - **Error Message**: `"The requested webhook 'api/forms/analyze' is not registered"`
   - **Root Cause**: Need to manually activate webhook before testing
   - **Solution**: Click "Execute workflow" button in n8n canvas

### **Critical Understanding:**
n8n webhooks in **development/test mode** require manual activation and only work for **ONE call** per activation.

---

## **Correct Testing Process** ‚úÖ

### **Step 1: Activate Webhook in n8n**
1. Open your n8n workflow
2. Click the **"Execute workflow"** button on the canvas
3. Webhook becomes active for exactly **ONE test call**

### **Step 2: Immediately Send Test Request**
```bash
curl -X POST https://primary-production-1af6.up.railway.app/webhook-test/api/forms/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"formData":{"email":"test@test.com","loanType":"refinance"}}'
```

### **Step 3: Repeat Process for Each Test**
- Each test requires **re-activation** in n8n
- Click "Execute workflow" ‚Üí Send curl ‚Üí Check results
- Webhook becomes inactive after each successful call

---

## **Test Results Validation** ‚úÖ

### **G1 Test Result (WORKING!):**
```json
{
  "formData": {
    "email": "test@test.com", 
    "loanType": "refinance"
  },
  "gate": "G1",
  "lead": {
    "score": 41,           // ‚úÖ Improved from old ~19
    "segment": "Developing", // ‚úÖ Better than old "Cold"
    "scoreBreakdown": {
      "completeness": 15,   // ‚úÖ 2/4 fields vs old 2/8
      "finance": 15,        // ‚úÖ 40-25 G1 penalty
      "urgency": 8,         // ‚úÖ Default urgency
      "engagement": 3,      // ‚úÖ G1 engagement
      "rawScore": 41
    }
  }
}
```

**üéâ Lead Scoring Fix Confirmed Working:**
- **Old G1**: ~19 points (Cold)
- **New G1**: 41 points (Developing) = +22 point improvement!

## **What to Look For in Results**

### **Key Improvements Implemented:**

1. **‚úÖ No More Artificial Income Penalty**
   - G2 leads: -5 penalty instead of -20
   - Only G3 gets full income assessment

2. **‚úÖ Gate-Appropriate Field Expectations**
   - G1/G2: Uses 4 basic fields (name, email, phone, loanType)
   - G3: Uses 8 complete fields (includes monthlyIncome, etc.)

3. **‚úÖ Loan-Specific Bonuses**
   - New Purchase: +2 for purchaseTimeline, +2 for propertyType
   - Refinance: +2 for propertyValue, +2 for outstandingLoan, +2 for lockInStatus  
   - Cash Equity: +2 for equityNeeded, +2 for purpose

4. **‚úÖ Intelligent Financial Assessment**
   - Refinance: Uses LTV ratio (propertyValue/outstandingLoan)
   - Good LTV (<60%): +5 bonus
   - High LTV (>80%): -10 penalty

5. **‚úÖ Proper Urgency Mapping**
   - purchaseTimeline: "next_3_months" ‚Üí 12 points
   - lockInStatus: "ending_soon" ‚Üí 15 points
   - Default ‚Üí 8 points

### **Expected Score Ranges:**
- **G1**: ~35-45 (Developing) - Was ~15-25 (Cold)
- **G2**: ~75-95 (Qualified/Premium) - Was ~40-50 (Developing)
- **G3**: ~60-100 (All segments) - Will be realistic with full data

## **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **‚ùå "Authorization data is wrong!"**
- **Solution**: Not an auth issue - activate webhook in n8n first

### **‚ùå "Webhook not registered"**  
- **Solution**: Click "Execute workflow" in n8n canvas

### **‚ùå "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"**
- **Solution**: Response is HTML error, not JSON - check webhook activation

### **‚ùå No response or timeout**
- **Solution**: Webhook expired after one use - re-activate in n8n

---

## **Production vs Test Mode**

### **Test Mode (Current):**
- Requires manual activation per test
- Webhook URL: `webhook-test/api/forms/analyze`
- Only works for one call per activation

### **Production Mode:**
- Always active, no manual activation needed  
- Webhook URL: `api/forms/analyze` (without webhook-test)
- Unlimited calls

### **To Switch to Production:**
1. In n8n, change webhook node from "Test" to "Production"
2. Deploy workflow
3. Use production URL for continuous testing

---

## **Integration Notes**

### **Frontend Integration:**
Your NextNest form should POST to:
```javascript
// Production endpoint (when ready)
const response = await fetch('https://primary-production-1af6.up.railway.app/api/forms/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ formData: formData })
});
```

### **Expected Response Format:**
```javascript
{
  formData: { /* original form data */ },
  gate: "G1" | "G2" | "G3",
  lead: {
    score: number,           // 0-100
    segment: "Cold" | "Developing" | "Qualified" | "Premium",
    dsr: number | null,      // Only available with income data
    scoreBreakdown: { /* detailed breakdown */ }
  },
  // ... additional workflow data
}
```
