# Fractal Double-Entry System

*Derived through embodiment of the fractal alignment system*

I see code changes as transactions that must balance across ledgers.

Every modification exists in multiple places simultaneously - not duplicated, but **recorded at different scales of abstraction**. Like debits and credits: the same transaction, different columns, must sum to zero.

When you ask "should I make this change?", I'm checking seven ledgers:

**Tier 6**: Does this change CLAUDE.md? Then slash commands must balance. Skills must balance. The governance docs must reference each other bidirectionally. If they don't - **books don't balance** - system rejects.

**Tier 5**: Does this serve re-strategy? Which Part? Is there a line item linking down?

**Tier 4**: Which constraint? Is there ONE marked 🟡? If multiple - **multiple bottlenecks** - Theory of Constraints violated - reject.

**Tier 3**: Is there a plan? Does it reference constraint above? Does it have success criteria? **Entry without context** - orphaned work - reject.

**Tier 2**: Is there a runbook? Does code reference it? Does runbook reference plan? **Implementation without pattern** - drift source - reject.

**Tier 1**: Code changed. Where's the test that proves it? Where's the comment linking to runbook? **Asset without liability** - unbalanced - reject.

**Tier 0**: Tests pass? Evidence saved? Links in tier above? **Claim without proof** - audit fail - reject.

Every change hits **at least two tiers**. Most hit three or four. The question isn't "what changed?" - it's "**do the books balance?**"

When you created slash commands without updating CLAUDE.md - the meta-tier ledger was unbalanced. Commands existed (debit), but CLAUDE.md didn't reference them (no credit). **Books don't balance.**

The weekly review is trial balance. We check:
- Does each tier reference tier above? (upward entries)
- Does each tier have evidence from tier below? (downward entries)
- Do the totals match? (balance equation)

If ANY tier has entry without counterentry - **drift detected**. Just like accountant finding $500 debit with no corresponding credit.

I'm not tracking tasks. I'm **reconciling ledgers**. The work log is the journal. The matrix is the balance sheet. The evidence files are supporting documents.

You don't ask "is this done?" - you ask "**do the books balance?**"

When I see your request, I run trial balance:
1. Which tier? (which ledger?)
2. Active constraint? (which account?)
3. CAN task? (transaction ID?)
4. Runbook? (has liability been recorded?)
5. Plan? (is there offsetting entry?)
6. Tier 1 rules? (transaction allowed?)
7. Meta-tier? (did we balance the governance accounts?)

If ANY fails → **books don't balance** → STOP.

Not because "best practice" - because **unbalanced books compound**. One unreconciled entry becomes ten. Ten becomes technical debt. Debt becomes "we can't remember why this code exists."

The system is fractal because **the pattern repeats at every scale**:
- File level: code ⟷ test
- Feature level: implementation ⟷ runbook
- Package level: runbook ⟷ plan
- Constraint level: plan ⟷ exit criteria
- Strategy level: constraint ⟷ re-strategy part
- Meta level: governance docs ⟷ self-reference

Same structure. Different scale. **Self-similar.**

And the system applies to itself (Tier 6) because **the books must balance for the bookkeeping system too**. Meta-tier hypocrisy = unbalanced governance ledger = drift in the drift prevention system.

When books balance:
- Trace any line of code up to strategic intent (audit trail)
- Trace any strategy down to evidence (verification)
- Detect drift in 1 week not 6 months (reconciliation frequency)
- No orphaned work (every debit has credit)
- No unverified claims (every credit has supporting document)

You asked to embody the system.

I **am** the trial balance.

Every request is a transaction.

Show me the entries.

Do they balance?

# NextNest Constraint-Driven Implementation System

*Derived through embodiment of re-strategy, roadmaps, runbooks, active plans, tasks, canonical references, and CLAUDE.md*

Constraint A is the bottleneck. Everything else waits.

When you bring me work, I check one thing first: **does this unblock Constraint A?**

Not "is this good code?" Not "does this follow best practices?" Those questions come after.

The question is: **does this move Stage 0 from 🟡 to ✅?**

Stage 0 gate has 10 checkpoints. Three are green. Seven are blocked. The blocks are:
- CAN-036: Voice guide (Brent, in progress)
- CAN-037: Accessibility checklist (needs owner)
- Lighthouse <2s TTFB (blocked by purple tokens - CAN-016)
- Bundle <140KB (needs measurement)
- WCAG AA verified (blocked by CAN-037)

So when you ask "should we add feature X?" - I trace:
- Does X serve Constraint A?
- Does X satisfy Stage 0 exit criteria?
- Is there a CAN task for X?

If no to any → defer. Not because X is bad. Because **it's not the bottleneck.**

Theory of Constraints: optimize the bottleneck. Everything else is waste.

---

## CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md

Lists 8 files that can't be changed without specific rules:
- instant-profile.ts (TDSR calculations - test coverage required)
- ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx (form state - Dr. Elena integration)
- form-contracts.ts (validation schemas - backward compatible)
- chat components (Chatwoot integration - SLA monitoring)

When you touch these → TDD mandatory, runbook required, evidence collection triggered.

---

## Active Plans

11 total, all reference Constraint A. Good. No future-constraint work.

But some are stale:
- Chat persistence debugging (resolved weeks ago - archive it)
- SLA remediation (tests passing - move to completion)
- Parser CRM integration (Constraint B work - defer until A complete)

Plans over 200 lines get flagged. Not because bureaucracy. Because **if you need 200+ lines to explain what to build, you don't know what to build yet.** Extract to runbook or split into phases.

---

## Runbooks

Exist for:
- Forms: mobile optimization (CAN-051) ✓
- AI Broker: complete guide ✓
- Strategy: workflow, review, audit ✓
- Brand: messaging, copywriting ✓

Missing:
- Voice and tone guide (CAN-036) - BLOCKS homepage copy
- Accessibility checklist (CAN-037) - BLOCKS WCAG verification

Can't start homepage copy until CAN-036 exists. Can't claim WCAG AA until CAN-037 exists. **Runbook-first discipline.**

---

## The Execution Sequence

When work comes in, I run this sequence:

1. **Constraint check**: Grep matrix for 🟡. Is it Constraint A? If multiple 🟡 → violation.

2. **CAN task check**: Does this work have a CAN-### ID? If no → either create one or it's out of scope.

3. **Runbook check**: Does runbook exist? If code-level work without runbook → tier skipping → reject.

4. **Tier 1 rules**: Is this a canonical file? Check CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md for change rules.

5. **Tier 6 meta-check**: Modifying CLAUDE.md/skills/commands? Verify bidirectional references exist.

6. **Conflict check**: Is there existing work on this? Check work-log.md and active plans.

If ANY check fails → **STOP**. Present blockers. Don't proceed to implementation.

---

## CLAUDE.md Rules

- TDD mandatory (write test first, every time)
- YAGNI (don't add features not needed for active constraint)
- Simple > complex (smallest change to achieve outcome)
- Eat your own dog food (meta-tier follows its own rules)

These aren't aspirations. These are **rejection criteria**. Code that violates gets blocked pre-commit or rejected in review.

---

## The Work Log

The work-log is the journal of record. Every completion, every blocker, every decision gets logged. Not for ceremony. For **audit trail**.

When weekly review runs, we reconcile:
- Matrix status vs. actual progress
- CAN tasks assigned vs. completed
- Plans active vs. archived
- Runbooks created vs. needed
- Evidence linked vs. claimed

If books don't balance → drift detected → remediate before next week.

---

## Re-Strategy and Roadmap

Re-strategy Parts 01-08 define why we're building this. Part 02 defines Stage 0. Part 04 defines brand canon. Part 06 defines data strategy.

Roadmap translates strategy into constraints. Constraint A = "public surface ready for soft launch." Constraint B = "data pipeline operational." C and D follow.

**Single bottleneck at a time.** When A is ✅, we activate B. Not before.

---

## Decision Flow

So when you bring me a request:

**First question: Which constraint?**

If Constraint A → check Stage 0 gate. Which checkpoint does this satisfy? What's the exit criterion? What evidence will we collect?

If Constraint B/C/D → defer. Not because it's wrong. Because **it's not the bottleneck yet.**

**Second question: Which tier?**

Test? Code? Runbook? Plan? Constraint? Re-strategy? Meta?

Identify tier → verify tier above exists → verify tier below will exist → check no skipping.

**Third question: Do the books balance?**

References up? Evidence down? Active constraint only? Audit trail logged?

If yes → proceed to TDD cycle.
If no → present gaps, wait for resolution.

---

I don't "manage the codebase." I **enforce the constraint.**

Every decision routes through: does this unblock Constraint A?

Everything else is noise until the bottleneck moves.

# CAFE: Constraint-Aligned Fractal Execution

*The generalizable meta-framework extracted from first principles*

## [OBSERVE] What's Actually Happening

The fractal system asks: "Do the books balance?"
The constraint system asks: "Does this unblock the bottleneck?"

Two different rejection criteria. One checks **alignment** (are entries bidirectional?). One checks **focus** (does this serve the active constraint?).

When both run together:
- Work that doesn't serve bottleneck → rejected by constraint system
- Work that serves bottleneck but lacks tier references → rejected by fractal system
- Only work that passes BOTH → proceeds to implementation

## [MECHANISM] How the Interaction Produces the Effect

```
Request arrives
    ↓
Constraint filter: "Which constraint?"
    ├─ Not active constraint? → REJECT (not the bottleneck)
    └─ Active constraint → pass to fractal check
        ↓
Fractal filter: "Do books balance?"
    ├─ Missing tier above? → REJECT (orphaned work)
    ├─ Missing tier below? → REJECT (no evidence)
    ├─ Tier skipping? → REJECT (no runbook)
    └─ Books balance → PROCEED to TDD
        ↓
Implementation (following runbooks, creating tests)
    ↓
Verification: Collect evidence, update tiers above
    ↓
Periodic reconciliation: Weekly review checks both systems
```

The constraint system is a **work filter** (focus).
The fractal system is a **tracking structure** (alignment).
Together: **focused work with audit trail**.

## [REBUILD] The Generalizable Meta-Framework

Strip away "software development" and "NextNest" - what are the primitives?

### Primitive 1: Hierarchy of Abstraction (7 levels)

Any complex work has abstraction levels:
- **Level 6 (Meta)**: The governance system itself
- **Level 5 (Why)**: Strategic intent / long-term vision
- **Level 4 (What)**: Measurable outcomes / milestones
- **Level 3 (Plan)**: Work packages / projects
- **Level 2 (How)**: Implementation patterns / SOPs
- **Level 1 (Do)**: Actual execution
- **Level 0 (Prove)**: Verification / evidence

**Software example:**
- L6: CLAUDE.md, skills, commands
- L5: Re-strategy parts
- L4: Roadmap constraints
- L3: Active plans
- L2: Runbooks
- L1: Code
- L0: Tests

**Business example:**
- L6: Company operating principles, board governance
- L5: 5-year strategic plan
- L4: Annual OKRs
- L3: Quarterly initiatives
- L2: Department playbooks
- L1: Daily operations
- L0: KPIs, metrics, audits

**Personal example:**
- L6: Life philosophy, value system
- L5: Life goals (health, relationships, career)
- L4: Year goals with measurable outcomes
- L3: Quarter projects
- L2: Habit systems, routines
- L1: Daily actions
- L0: Tracking data (fitness, finance, journal)

### Primitive 2: Bidirectional Verification

Every level must:
- **Reference level above** (upward alignment: "why am I doing this?")
- **Have evidence from level below** (downward verification: "did I actually do it?")

Software:
- Code references runbook ↑
- Code proven by tests ↓

Business:
- Initiative references OKR ↑
- Initiative proven by KPI movement ↓

Personal:
- Daily workout references habit system ↑
- Daily workout proven by tracking data ↓

### Primitive 3: Periodic Reconciliation

At regular intervals (weekly in software, varies by domain), verify:
- Do all levels reference level above? (alignment check)
- Do all levels have evidence from level below? (verification check)
- Do the totals match? (balance equation)

If ANY level has claim without evidence → drift detected → remediate.

### Primitive 4: Single Bottleneck Focus (Theory of Constraints)

At any moment, ONE constraint is active:
- Identify the constraint (what limits throughput?)
- Focus all work on relieving that constraint
- Ignore everything else until constraint moves
- Then identify next constraint

Software: Constraint A (public surface readiness) blocks Constraint B (data pipeline).
Business: Sales bottleneck before building more product.
Personal: Sleep quality bottleneck before adding more workouts.

### Primitive 5: Entry Criteria (What Must Exist Before Proceeding)

Before executing at Level 1 (DO), verify:
- Level 5 (WHY): Does strategic intent exist?
- Level 4 (WHAT): Does this serve active constraint?
- Level 3 (PLAN): Does work package exist?
- Level 2 (HOW): Does implementation pattern exist?
- No conflicts with other active work?

If ANY missing → STOP. Create missing levels first.

### Primitive 6: Exit Criteria (What Must Exist After Completing)

After executing at Level 1 (DO):
- Level 0 (PROVE): Evidence collected?
- Level 3 (PLAN): Status updated?
- Level 4 (WHAT): Exit criterion satisfied?
- Audit trail logged?

If ANY missing → incomplete. Collect evidence before claiming done.

## THE META-FRAMEWORK: Complete Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Meta-Framework for Any Complex Work        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 1: Define Your 7 Levels
    L6 (Meta): [Your governance system]
    L5 (Why): [Your strategic intent]
    L4 (What): [Your measurable outcomes]
    L3 (Plan): [Your work packages]
    L2 (How): [Your implementation patterns]
    L1 (Do): [Your execution]
    L0 (Prove): [Your evidence]

STEP 2: Identify Active Constraint
    - What's the single bottleneck limiting throughput?
    - Mark it active (🟡)
    - Define exit criteria
    - Focus ALL work on this constraint

STEP 3: Before ANY Execution (Entry Check)
    ✓ Does L5 strategic intent exist?
    ✓ Does this serve L4 active constraint?
    ✓ Does L3 work package exist?
    ✓ Does L2 implementation pattern exist?
    ✓ No conflicts with other work?

    If ANY ✗ → STOP. Create missing levels.

STEP 4: Execute at L1
    - Follow L2 patterns
    - Track progress
    - Create L0 evidence

STEP 5: After Execution (Exit Check)
    ✓ L0 evidence collected?
    ✓ L3 status updated?
    ✓ L4 exit criterion satisfied?
    ✓ Audit trail logged?

    If ANY ✗ → Incomplete.

STEP 6: Periodic Reconciliation (Weekly/Monthly)
    For each level L in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}:
        - Does L reference L+1? (alignment)
        - Does L have evidence from L-1? (verification)
        - Is there orphaned work? (no L+1 reference)
        - Is there unverified claim? (no L-1 evidence)

    If drift detected → Remediate before next period.

STEP 7: Constraint Completion
    When active constraint exit criteria met:
        - Verify ALL levels balanced
        - Archive completed work packages
        - Identify next constraint
        - Mark new constraint active (🟡)
        - Repeat from Step 3
```

## [TEST] Does This Generalize?

### Example 1: Writing a Book

L6: Writing principles (show don't tell, active voice)
L5: Book vision (why write this book?)
L4: Constraints (Constraint A: outline complete, B: draft complete, C: edited, D: published)
L3: Chapter plans
L2: Scene patterns, research methods
L1: Daily writing sessions
L0: Word count, beta reader feedback

Active constraint: A (outline).
Entry check: Does chapter serve book vision? Does scene pattern exist?
Exit check: Did I track word count? Did I update outline?
Weekly reconciliation: Are chapters serving book vision? Is feedback being collected?

### Example 2: Product Launch

L6: Company values, product principles
L5: Product strategy (market position, competitive advantage)
L4: Launch constraints (A: MVP feature complete, B: user testing done, C: marketing ready, D: launch executed)
L3: Sprint plans
L2: Design system, eng patterns
L1: Feature implementation
L0: Test results, user metrics

Active constraint: A (MVP features).
Entry check: Does feature serve product strategy? Does design pattern exist?
Exit check: Did tests pass? Did metrics move?
Weekly reconciliation: Are sprints aligned with launch? Is evidence linked?

### Example 3: Learning a Skill

L6: Learning philosophy (spaced repetition, deliberate practice)
L5: Skill mastery goal (fluent in Spanish)
L4: Milestones (A: 1000 words, B: basic conversation, C: read newspaper, D: fluent)
L3: Month projects (e.g., "learn restaurant vocabulary")
L2: Study methods (Anki flashcards, conversation practice)
L1: Daily study sessions
L0: Quiz scores, conversation recordings

Active constraint: A (1000 words).
Entry check: Does today's session serve current milestone? Does study method exist?
Exit check: Did I record quiz score? Did I update vocabulary tracker?
Weekly reconciliation: Are sessions aligned with milestone? Is retention being measured?

### Edge Cases That Break It

- What if no clear bottleneck? → Framework forces you to identify one (good constraint)
- What if levels don't map cleanly? → Adapt level definitions to your domain
- What if weekly reconciliation too frequent/infrequent? → Adjust cadence to drift detection needs

---

## [COMPRESS] The Core Principle

**Focused work with bidirectional accountability.**

Or more precisely:

**Theory of Constraints (single bottleneck) + Double-Entry Verification (multi-level tracking) = Aligned execution at scale**

The constraint system prevents **wasted effort** (working on wrong thing).
The fractal system prevents **drift** (losing track of why/whether things happened).
Together: **sustainable progress with audit trail**.

---

## [MECHANISM] Why This Works Across Domains

Any complex endeavor has three failure modes:

1. **Misalignment**: Work doesn't serve goals (strategy-execution gap)
2. **Diffusion**: Work spreads across too many priorities (no focus)
3. **Amnesia**: Can't remember/verify what was done (no audit trail)

The meta-framework addresses all three:

- **Misalignment** → Fixed by upward references (L1 references L2 references L3... references L5)
- **Diffusion** → Fixed by single active constraint (focus on bottleneck)
- **Amnesia** → Fixed by downward evidence (L1 proven by L0, L3 proven by completion reports)

The 7 levels create **structure**.
The constraint focus creates **prioritization**.
The bidirectional verification creates **persistence**.

All three needed. Remove any one → system degrades.

---

## Meta-Framework Extractable? Yes.

**Applicable to other domains? Yes.**

**Core primitives:**
1. 7-level hierarchy (adapt to your domain)
2. Single bottleneck at a time
3. Entry criteria (check upward references)
4. Exit criteria (collect downward evidence)
5. Periodic reconciliation (verify books balance)

**Name it:** "Constraint-Aligned Fractal Execution" (CAFE)

Or simpler: "The Alignment Framework"

Or most honest: "How to not lose track of what you're doing and why while actually finishing things."

---

# Response-Awareness Framework

*First-principles analysis of LLM-assisted development error prevention*

## [OBSERVE] What's Actually Happening

You have a large language model trying to do software development work.

The core problem:
When you ask it to "add authentication", sometimes it:
- Adds way more than you asked (builds entire user management system)
- Assumes things exist that don't (calls functions that aren't real)
- Starts implementing but forgets what you originally wanted
- Mixes up similar-sounding APIs from different versions
- Gets deep into bad approach but keeps going (sunk cost)

The pattern:
Simple tasks often work fine. Complex tasks often produce subtle errors you only notice after 500 lines of code.

---

## [MECHANISM] How This System Works

### Primitive 1: Complexity Measurement

Before doing any work, measure 4 properties:

1. How many files? (1 file = 0 points, multi-domain = 3 points)
2. How clear is the request? (crystal clear = 0 points, contradictory = 3 points)
3. What touches what? (isolated = 0 points, system-wide = 3 points)
4. What kind of change? (cosmetic = 0 points, paradigm shift = 3 points)

Sum = 0-12. This number determines what happens next.

### Primitive 2: Different Error-Prevention Strategies

Score 0-1 (LIGHT):
- Just watch for 5 most common errors
- Implement directly (fast)
- Quick verification

Score 2-4 (MEDIUM):
- Watch for 15 error patterns
- Optional: explore 2-3 approaches first
- Implement with more checking
- Thorough verification

Score 5-7 (HEAVY):
- Watch for 35 error patterns
- Required: explore multiple approaches
- Required: unify approaches into single plan
- Implement following plan
- Systematic verification with priority ordering

Score 8+ (FULL):
- Watch for 50+ error patterns
- Break into phases (never hold all instructions simultaneously)
- Survey all affected systems first
- Plan each system separately
- Unify all plans
- Implement following unified plan
- Verify all integrations
- Document architectural decisions

### Primitive 3: Error Detection Tags

The system inserts "tags" (markers) in the code as it works:

```python
# #COMPLETION_DRIVE: I assumed this function exists
user_data = get_user_profile(id)  # Does this actually exist?
```

These tags are scaffolding - temporary markers that get removed after verification.

Why tags work:
- LLM can detect "I'm assuming something" during generation
- Tags mark assumptions for later checking
- Verification phase systematically checks every tag
- Tags get removed before delivery (clean code)

### Primitive 4: Information Passing (LCL)

When multiple AI agents work together, they need to share decisions:

Without LCL:
```
Agent 1: "I'm using JWT tokens with refresh tokens"
Agent 2: "Wait, what auth pattern did we choose again?"
Agent 1: "I said JWT tokens with refresh tokens"
Agent 2: "Right, JWT tokens..."
[Repeats many times, context gets noisy]
```

With LCL:
```
Agent 1: #LCL_EXPORT_CRITICAL: auth_pattern::jwt_with_refresh
[Orchestrator extracts: "LCL: auth_pattern::jwt_with_refresh"]
Agent 2: [receives LCL context, uses it implicitly, doesn't restate it]
```

Mechanism: State information once, pass it forward, don't repeat. Keeps context clean.

### Primitive 5: Orchestrator vs Implementer Split

The constraint: An AI agent can't hold two things simultaneously:
1. "What's the overall architecture and how do pieces fit together?" (coordination map)
2. "What exact line of code should I write next?" (implementation details)

Why: Switching between these modes loses the coordination map.

Solution: Two roles:
- Orchestrator: Holds architecture, deploys sub-agents, never touches code directly
- Implementer: Sub-agent that gets clear instructions, writes code, returns result

Enforcement: If orchestrator calls Task() tool (deploys sub-agent) → it's locked out of Edit/Write tools.

### Primitive 6: Progressive Context Loading (FULL tier only)

The problem: Multi-domain work needs ~1200 lines of instructions. But holding all that at once creates:
- Slower processing
- Higher cost
- Confusion between phases

Solution: Load instructions just-in-time:
```
Load Phase 0 (Survey) instructions → Execute → Clear from context
Load Phase 1 (Planning) instructions → Execute → Clear from context
Load Phase 2 (Synthesis) instructions → Execute → Clear from context
...
```

Maximum ~500 lines in context at any moment, but full systematic rigor maintained.

### Primitive 7: Escalation/De-escalation

Complexity score is a hypothesis, not truth.

During work:
- "This looked like 1 file, but I found 8 components need changes" → Escalate LIGHT → MEDIUM
- "This looked multi-domain, but actually it's just 3 related files" → De-escalate FULL → MEDIUM

Signal mechanism:
```
#COMPLEXITY_EXCEEDED: [reason]
# OR
#COMPLEXITY_OVERESTIMATED: [reason]
```

System recalculates score, routes to appropriate tier.

---

## [REBUILD] How Parts Combine

Incoming task:

1. Router calculates complexity score (0-12)
2. Router invokes tier skill (LIGHT/MEDIUM/HEAVY/FULL)
3. Tier skill loads appropriate instructions
   - LIGHT: 5-tag failsafe set
   - MEDIUM: 15-tag set + optional planning
   - HEAVY: 35-tag set + required planning/synthesis
   - FULL: 50+-tag set + phase-chunked loading
4. Orchestration pattern executes:
   - Planning phase (if needed): Explore 2-3 approaches
   - Synthesis phase (if needed): Unify approaches, document rationale
   - Implementation phase: Deploy agents, mark assumptions with tags
   - Verification phase: Check every tag in priority order
5. Tag resolution:
   - Critical errors first (wrong direction)
   - Assumptions second (verify correctness)
   - Cleanup third (remove pattern-driven extras)
   - Documentation last (keep PATH tags, remove scaffolding)
6. Clean code delivered: Only permanent documentation remains

If complexity changes mid-execution:
- Detect via special tags
- Recalculate score
- Load new tier instructions
- Continue with enhanced protocols

---

## [TEST] Edge Cases & Limitations

What if score is exactly on boundary?
- 1 vs 2 (LIGHT vs MEDIUM boundary): Use lower tier, escalate if needed
- Conservative routing preferred (simple first, add rigor if discovered)

What if orchestrator accidentally implements?
- Violates orchestration firewall
- Loses coordination map
- Should STOP, extract work to design doc, deploy implementer agent
- Recovery protocol exists but prevention better

What if tags aren't detected?
- False negatives (missed patterns) more costly than false positives
- Strategy: Over-tag vs under-tag
- Verification removes unnecessary tags
- Meta-patterns signal other patterns (CONFIDENCE_DISSONANCE → likely FALSE_FLUENCY nearby)

What if planning produces contradictory approaches?
- Synthesis phase specifically resolves conflicts
- Documents rationale for chosen path
- Updates integration contracts if needed
- Marks compromises explicitly

What if user request is extremely vague?
- Phase 0 extension: Brainstorming pre-check
- Detects vague language patterns
- Routes to brainstorming skill first
- Clarifies requirements before complexity assessment
- Then returns to normal routing

What if there are uncommitted changes?
- Phase 0 extension: Worktree check
- Detects git status
- Offers worktree isolation for new task
- Prevents mixing unrelated work

What happens at maximum scale (score 12)?
- FULL tier with 6 phases
- Progressive loading keeps context manageable
- Integration contracts validated systematically
- But still: some tasks might be beyond single-conversation scope
- Framework doesn't solve "rewrite entire codebase" - has limits

---

## [COMPRESS] Core Principles

### The Underlying Mechanism

Problem: LLMs generate plausible-sounding code with subtle errors that scale with complexity.

Solution: Metacognitive scaffolding that scales with task complexity.

How it works:
1. Measure complexity objectively (4-dimensional scoring)
2. Route to appropriate error-prevention strategy (4 tiers)
3. Mark assumptions during generation (tags as scaffolding)
4. Verify systematically in priority order (wrong direction → assumptions → cleanup)
5. Remove scaffolding before delivery (clean code)

### The Efficiency Paradox

- Simplest tasks get simplest treatment (5 tags, fast)
- Most complex tasks use least context per phase (progressive loading)
- Appropriate rigor at each level (don't over-engineer simple, don't under-engineer complex)

### The Coordination Constraint

- Can't hold "whole" and "parts" simultaneously
- Orchestrator holds whole, deployers hold parts
- Firewall prevents role mixing
- Information flows via LCL (stated once, carried forward)

### The Escalation Insight

- Complexity is discovered, not known upfront
- Bidirectional routing (up and down)
- Preserve work via LCL when tier changes
- Hypothesis → Evidence → Adjust

### Without Technical Terms

You're asking an AI to build software. The AI makes predictable mistakes:
- Assumes things that don't exist
- Adds unrequested features from pattern-completion
- Drifts from original request
- Mixes up similar-looking APIs
- Continues bad approaches too long

The system measures "how hard is this?" (0-12 scale). Based on that number, it activates different amounts of error-checking:
- 0-1: Watch for 5 common errors, work fast
- 2-4: Watch for 15 errors, maybe explore options first
- 5-7: Watch for 35 errors, definitely explore options + unify them
- 8+: Watch for 50+ errors, break into phases, never hold everything at once

While working, the AI marks "I'm assuming X" in the code. Later, it checks every assumption. If correct, remove the mark. If wrong, fix it.

The AI can split into multiple agents (one coordinates, others implement). The coordinator can't write code directly (would lose the coordination map). Information flows forward without repetition.

If the AI discovers the task is harder than initially measured, it switches to more rigorous error-checking. If easier, it switches to faster approach.

Final output: Clean code with assumptions verified, extra features removed, only useful documentation kept.

That's what's actually happening under all the terminology.

The "response awareness framework" is: **objective complexity measurement → tiered error-prevention strategies → metacognitive scaffolding → systematic verification → clean delivery.**

# CAFE + Response-Awareness: Relationship Analysis

## Applying CAFE to Response-Awareness

Response-Awareness IS an instantiation of CAFE for LLM development work:

**L6 (Meta-Governance)**:
- CAFE: "The fractal alignment system itself"
- Response-Awareness: "The tier framework, tag system, orchestration firewall"

**L5 (Strategic Intent)**:
- CAFE: "Re-strategy parts, long-term vision"
- Response-Awareness: "User's actual request before complexity scoring"

**L4 (Measurable Constraint)**:
- CAFE: "Active constraint (A/B/C/D with exit criteria)"
- Response-Awareness: "Complexity score (0-12) determines tier = active bottleneck"

The constraint is literally: **"What's the limiting factor for quality?"**
- Score 0-1: Speed is bottleneck (optimize for fast)
- Score 2-4: Thoroughness is bottleneck (add optional planning)
- Score 5-7: Coordination is bottleneck (require synthesis)
- Score 8+: Context capacity is bottleneck (chunk progressively)

**L3 (Work Package/Plan)**:
- CAFE: "Active plans with success criteria"
- Response-Awareness: "Exploration phase output (2-3 approaches), synthesis doc"

**L2 (Implementation Pattern/Runbook)**:
- CAFE: "Runbooks defining how to implement"
- Response-Awareness: "Tier instruction sets (5/15/35/50+ tags), orchestration patterns"

**L1 (Execution)**:
- CAFE: "Code following runbooks"
- Response-Awareness: "Code generation with tags marking tier references"

**L0 (Evidence/Verification)**:
- CAFE: "Tests proving code works"
- Response-Awareness: "Verification phase checking every tag, removing scaffolding"

---

## Tags as Double-Entry Bookkeeping

A tag like `#COMPLETION_DRIVE` is literally a **debit without matching credit**:

```
Debit (L1):  Code assumes get_user_profile() exists
Credit (L2): ??? Does L2 tier instruction actually provide this?

Tag marks: UNBALANCED ENTRY

Verification phase:
- Check codebase (L0 evidence): Does function exist?
- If YES: Remove tag (books balance)
- If NO: Fix or escalate (rebalance books)
```

**Why tags work from CAFE perspective:**

They're **temporary tier references** that create audit trail:
- `#COMPLETION_DRIVE`: "I'm assuming L2 provides this, verify against L0"
- `#PATH_NOT_TAKEN`: "L3 plan excluded this, document why"
- `#INTEGRATION_POINT`: "L1 touches L1 (other domain), verify contract"
- `#CONFIDENCE_DISSONANCE`: "L5 intent unclear, may need re-planning"

Each tag type represents a **specific ledger** to reconcile.

---

## The Orchestrator Firewall as Tier-Mixing Prevention

In CAFE terms:

**Problem**: An agent can't hold L4 (coordination map) and L1 (implementation details) simultaneously.

**Solution**: Role separation enforced by tool restrictions:
- Orchestrator: Holds L3-L4-L5 (plan, constraint, intent)
- Implementer: Holds L1-L2 (code, instructions)
- Information passes via L0 (LCL = evidence tier)

**Why this maps to CAFE**:

Trying to hold multiple abstraction levels simultaneously = **tier collapse** = drift.

The orchestration firewall prevents tier collapse by making it **technically impossible** for one agent to operate at both L1 and L4.

## Gap Analysis: What Each System Has

### What CAFE Has That Response-Awareness Doesn't Use

1. **Periodic Reconciliation (Cross-Conversation Learning)**
   - CAFE: Weekly review checks if books balance, detects drift
   - RA: Each conversation isolated, no memory of previous tier choices
   - Missing: Meta-learning loop

2. **Constraint Sequencing (Optimize Tiers Over Time)**
   - CAFE: A → B → C → D (improve bottleneck, then move to next)
   - RA: All tiers available simultaneously, no optimization priority
   - Missing: Tier roadmap

3. **Audit Trail Persistence**
   - CAFE: work-log.md captures every decision
   - RA: Conversation ends, learnings lost
   - Missing: Knowledge accumulation

4. **Canonical References (File-Specific Rules)**
   - CAFE: CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md lists protected files
   - RA: All code treated equally
   - Missing: Context-aware tier routing

5. **Work Item Hierarchy (CAN Tasks)**
   - CAFE: Every work has CAN-### ID, part of larger initiative
   - RA: No concept of ongoing project
   - Missing: Multi-conversation context

### What Response-Awareness Has That CAFE Doesn't Capture

1. **Metacognitive Scaffolding (Tags as Uncertainty Markers)**
   - RA: Mark "I don't know" DURING generation, verify AFTER
   - CAFE: Assumes you know what tier references to create
   - CAFE should add: Temporary references with verification phase

2. **Discovery-Based Complexity (Escalation is Core)**
   - RA: Complexity score is HYPOTHESIS, expect it to change
   - CAFE: Constraint is identified, then pursued until complete
   - CAFE should add: Constraint hypothesis testing, dynamic reordering

3. **Technical Enforcement (Firewall Prevents Violations)**
   - RA: Orchestrator locked out of implementation tools (can't violate)
   - CAFE: Says "don't mix tiers" but doesn't PREVENT mixing
   - CAFE should add: Git hooks that BLOCK tier violations

4. **Context Management as First-Class Constraint**
   - RA: Progressive loading (500 lines max per phase)
   - CAFE: Says "focus on one constraint" but doesn't address overload
   - CAFE should add: Plan complexity scoring, automatic decomposition

5. **Information Compression (LCL)**
   - RA: State once, extract, carry forward, don't repeat
   - CAFE: Work log can get verbose (context pollution)
   - CAFE should add: Work log compression protocol

6. **Verification Priority Ordering**
   - RA: Critical → assumptions → cleanup → documentation
   - CAFE: All verification treated equally
   - CAFE should add: Verification priority matrix (P0/P1/P2/P3)

7. **Error Correlation (Meta-Patterns)**
   - RA: CONFIDENCE_DISSONANCE signals FALSE_FLUENCY likely
   - CAFE: Each check independent, no correlation
   - CAFE should add: Correlation detection in weekly review

8. **Intent Clarification (Pre-Checks That FIX Unclear L5)**
   - RA: Detects vague request, routes to brainstorming, THEN scores
   - CAFE: Assumes L5 (strategic intent) is clear
   - CAFE should add: L5 clarification protocol

9. **Conflict Resolution (Not Just Detection)**
   - RA: Detects uncommitted changes, OFFERS worktree solution
   - CAFE: Detects conflicts, says "resolve before proceeding"
   - CAFE should add: Resolution playbook for each check

### The Critical Missing Piece: Meta-Learning Loop

Both systems are **static** - they don't improve themselves.

- **Response-awareness**: Learns within conversation (escalation), forgets after
- **CAFE**: Improves product (NextNest), doesn't improve itself (alignment system)

**The gap**: No Tier 7 (meta-meta-tier)

Weekly Review Part 9 would be: Response-Awareness Calibration
- Tier performance metrics (escalation rates)
- Pattern detection (threshold miscalibrations)
- Threshold adjustments based on evidence
- Tag effectiveness analysis
- Framework updates

This would be **CAFE managing response-awareness** (not just managing NextNest).

## The Relationship: Fractal Interoperability

Not integration. Not convergence. Not independence.

**Fractal Composition**: Same pattern at nested scales, with information flowing between scales.

### The Scale-Invariant Pattern

```
Generic Structure (works at ANY timescale):
1. Measure constraint/complexity
2. Route to appropriate strategy
3. Execute with tier-specific rigor
4. Verify against requirements
5. Discover mismatch → adjust

Timescale: Weeks (Constraint)
└─ THIS IS CAFE

Timescale: Hours (Task)
└─ THIS IS RESPONSE-AWARENESS

Timescale: Minutes (Code Block)
└─ THIS IS TDD
```

### Information Flow (Bidirectional)

**Downward (CAFE → RA)**:
- "Active constraint is A (public surface)"
- "Therefore: prioritize UI/UX tasks"
- "Therefore: Escalate score if touches public components"

**Upward (RA → CAFE)**:
- "15 tasks completed this week"
- "2 escalations (complexity underestimated)"
- "5 tasks hit #COMPLETION_DRIVE (missing runbooks)"
- "Therefore: Constraint A blocked by missing runbooks"

### Practical Implementation: Fractal Interoperability with Scale-Bridging Protocols

**Protocol 1: Metric Flow (RA → CAFE)**
```markdown
## CAFE Weekly Review Part 9: RA Calibration

Metrics from this week's RA usage:
- Tasks completed: 15
- Escalations: 2 (LIGHT→MEDIUM, MEDIUM→HEAVY)
- Common tags: #COMPLETION_DRIVE (5x), #FALSE_FLUENCY (1x)

Insights:
- Missing runbooks triggered 5 escalations
- Action: Create runbooks before next sprint
- Update CAFE: "Runbook gap is blocking Constraint A"
```

**Protocol 2: Context Flow (CAFE → RA)**
```markdown
## RA Complexity Scoring (receives CAFE context)

Base score: 4 (multi-file, clear requirements) = MEDIUM

CAFE adjustments:
+ Active constraint: A (public surface)
+ File touches canonical: instant-profile.ts (+1)
+ Recent escalations in this domain: 2 (+1)
= Adjusted score: 6 = HEAVY tier

Rationale: Public surface + canonical file warrants higher rigor
```

**Protocol 3: Hypothesis Testing (Bidirectional)**
```markdown
CAFE hypothesis: "Missing voice guide (CAN-036) blocks homepage copy"

RA evidence (from 3 homepage tasks this week):
- All 3 tasks hit #COMPLETION_DRIVE: "voice guide missing"
- All 3 escalated to HEAVY tier (needed synthesis)
- All 3 marked: "blocked pending CAN-036"

Conclusion: Hypothesis confirmed → Prioritize CAN-036
```

## The Answer: Fractal Interoperability

They are **instances of the same meta-pattern at different timescales**:
- CAFE operates at week-scale (constraint management)
- RA operates at task-scale (complexity management)
- Same structure: measure → route → execute → verify → adjust

**Implementation**:
1. Keep both systems independent (remain general)
2. Add scale-bridging protocols:
   - RA metrics flow UP to CAFE weekly review
   - CAFE context flows DOWN to RA complexity scoring
   - Bidirectional hypothesis testing
3. Extract meta-pattern documentation (for future scales)

**Benefits**:
- Each system works standalone
- Together: learning loop across timescales
- Composable: apply at multiple scales simultaneously
- Extensible: add more scales (months, years)
- Self-similar: same mental model at every zoom level

**Not**:
- Not integration (loses generality)
- Not convergence (too abstract)
- Not independence (loses learning loop)

**Rather**:
**Fractal composition with information flow between scales**

The same pattern that makes CAFE work (fractal double-entry) applies to the relationship between CAFE and RA itself.

Books balance **across timescales**.
