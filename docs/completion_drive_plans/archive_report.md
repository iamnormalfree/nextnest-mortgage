## Deprecation Notice Format

All archived files include a standardized deprecation notice at the top:

> **⚠️ [STATUS]**: [Brief description]
> **Use instead**: [Link to replacement]
> **Archived**: 2025-10-01
> **Reason**: [Detailed reason for archival]

[Original content below]
---
```

**Status Types Used**:
- **DEPRECATED**: Outdated content (pre-modern stack)
- **SUPERSEDED**: Replaced by better version
- **MERGED**: Consolidated into comprehensive document

---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Archival:
- **Total runbooks**: 21 files in root directory
- **Overlapping content**: Multiple guides covering same topics
- **Outdated references**: Guides referencing non-existent files
- **Confusion risk**: Multiple versions of similar guides

### After Archival:
- **Active runbooks**: 14 files in root directory (33% reduction)
- **Clear canonical references**: Single source of truth for each topic
- **Archive structure**: Organized historical documentation
- **Updated index**: Clear navigation with deprecation notes

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced confusion**: Clear which documents are current
2. **Easier navigation**: Fewer files to search through
3. **Preserved history**: Original content accessible with context
4. **Better maintainability**: Single canonical reference per topic
5. **Clear migration path**: Deprecation notices guide users to replacements

---

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created archive directory structure
2. ✅ Copied content to archive with deprecation notices
3. ✅ Deleted original outdated files
4. ✅ Updated README.md with archive section
5. ✅ Verified canonical references exist and are marked as such
6. ✅ Tested archive links point to correct locations
7. ✅ Confirmed replacement links are valid

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
- None required - archival complete

### Future Maintenance:
1. **Monthly review cycle**: Check canonical documents for updates needed
2. **Archive policy**: When consolidating docs, use same deprecation notice format
3. **Broken link checks**: Periodically verify archive links remain valid
4. **Purge policy**: Consider removing archives after 1 year if no longer referenced

### Documentation Standards Going Forward:
1. Mark canonical documents with `status: Canonical` in front matter
2. Use `replaces:` field in front matter to document consolidations
3. Always include `last_reviewed` date in canonical documents
4. When merging docs, archive originals with proper notices
