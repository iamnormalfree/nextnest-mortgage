**Created:** 2025-10-16T16:50:45  
**Planning Agent:** Expert Implementation Plan Analyst  
**Target:** Tasks 1-3 of Lead Form Chat Handoff Optimization

---

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses three critical issues in the NextNest mortgage lead form:
1. **P0 BLOCKER:** Chat transition trigger bug preventing broker handoff (off-by-one error)
2. **Missing test coverage:** No validation that chat transition works after Step 4 completion  
3. **UX friction:** Information overload in Step 3 causing user drop-off

**Impact if not fixed:**
- Users complete the form but NEVER reach AI brokers (100% conversion loss)
- No regression protection for critical user journey
- Users abandon at Step 3 due to cognitive overload (technical jargon, locked features)
