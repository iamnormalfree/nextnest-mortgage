# AI Chat Intelligence System - Phase 1 Planning

**Project Status:** Multi-Domain Planning Complete
**Response-Awareness Tier:** FULL
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Lead:** Documentation Specialist

## Project Overview

The AI Chat Intelligence System extends NextNest's response-awareness framework to create an intelligent, memory-enabled LLM chat workflow combining Dr. Elena's MAS-compliant mortgage calculations with human-like conversation intelligence.

## Document Index

| Document | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| README.md (this file) | Project overview | All stakeholders |
| PHASE1_ARCHITECTURE.md | System architecture analysis | Technical leads |
| PHASE1_DR_ELENA_INTEGRATION.md | Dr. Elena integration guide | Backend engineers |
| PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md | 6-week implementation roadmap | Product managers, engineers |
| PHASE1_DOMAIN_SURVEY.md | Codebase survey | System architects |

## Strategic Goals

1. Regulatory Compliance - Maintain MAS compliance
2. Cost Optimization - Achieve 83% token cost reduction
3. Memory Continuity - Enable persistent conversation context
4. Human-Like Intelligence - Deliver contextually aware responses
5. Production Reliability - Zero downtime deployment

## System Capabilities

### Current State
- 5 AI broker personas with personality matching
- Lead scoring and intelligent routing  
- Chatwoot integration for chat UI
- Human handoff capability
- Echo detection and deduplication

### Target State (Post-Phase 1)
- Memory-enabled conversations with persistent context
- Multi-model token optimization (83% cost reduction)
- Dr. Elena's MAS-compliant mortgage calculations
- Intent-based routing to specialized calculation modules
- BullMQ persistent queue replacing in-memory queue
- Vercel AI SDK replacing n8n dependency

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Week 1-2 | Foundation | ConversationStateManager, IntentRouter |
| Week 3-4 | Core Intelligence | CalculationOrchestrator, Multi-model |
| Week 5 | Integration | End-to-end testing |
| Week 6 | Production | Performance optimization, Gradual rollout |

## Key Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Response Time | 2-6s | 1-4s |
| Queue Persistence | 0% | 100% |
| Duplicate Rate | 5% | <1% |
| Conversation Continuity | 0% | 95% |

## Next Steps

1. Review all Phase 1 documentation
2. Validate architectural decisions
3. Confirm API budget
4. Set up Redis instance  
5. Create implementation branch

**Status:** Phase 1 Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
