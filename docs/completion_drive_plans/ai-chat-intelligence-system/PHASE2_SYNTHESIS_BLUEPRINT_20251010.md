**Purpose**: Flow mortgage form data into AI conversation context

**Validation Result**:
- Form data structure matches conversation context requirements
- All required fields present in both systems
- No type mismatches detected
- Transformation logic straightforward

**Implementation**: lib/ai/context-transformer.ts (NEW)

---

### Contract 2: CalculationToExplanationContract
**Status**: COMPATIBLE WITH FIXES REQUIRED  
**Purpose**: Transform calculation results into natural language explanations

**Validation Result**:
- Core structure compatible
- CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED in lib/calculations/mortgage.ts:
  1. Line 550-556: MSR property type check missing
  2. Income Recognition: Multipliers not implemented
  3. Stress Test Rate: Inconsistent enforcement (60% vs 100%)

**Fix Strategy**: Modify in place (see Conflict Resolution section)

---

### Contract 3: MemoryToContextContract
**Status**: COMPATIBLE  
**Purpose**: Load conversation history into active context

**Validation Result**:
- Redis short-term storage: 24-hour retention
- Supabase long-term storage: Permanent retention
- Retrieval patterns efficient (O(log n) with indexing)
- No impedance mismatch between storage layers

**Implementation**: lib/ai/conversation-memory.ts (NEW)

---

## Path Selection with PATH_RATIONALE

### Decision 1: AI Conversation Handler
**PATH**: Extend lib/ai/broker-ai-service.ts (NOT replace)

**RATIONALE**:
- Existing service handles 90% of required functionality
- 47 successful conversations in production demonstrate stability
- Replacement would introduce regression risk
- Extension preserves backward compatibility

**ACTION**: Add multi-model orchestration layer on top

**Files Modified**:
- lib/ai/broker-ai-service.ts (enhance with orchestrator)
- lib/ai/multi-model-orchestrator.ts (NEW)

---

### Decision 2: Mortgage Calculations
**PATH**: Fix lib/calculations/mortgage.ts in place

**RATIONALE**:
- Core calculation logic sound (validated against 3 lenders)
- Only 3 specific bugs identified:
  1. MSR property type check (7 lines)
  2. Income multipliers (15 lines)
  3. Stress test enforcement (3 lines)
- Total fix: ~25 lines of code
- Rewrite would risk introducing new errors

**ACTION**: Surgical fixes with comprehensive test coverage

**Files Modified**:
- lib/calculations/mortgage.ts (3 targeted fixes)

**Test Coverage Required**:
- Unit tests for each fix
- Regression tests for existing calculations
- Integration tests with AI explanation generation

---

### Decision 3: Conversation State Management
**PATH**: Create separate conversation-state-manager.ts

**RATIONALE**:
- Current state scattered across 4 files
- Centralization improves consistency, debugging, and testing

**ACTION**: Create dedicated state manager with clear interface

**Files Created**:
- lib/ai/conversation-state-manager.ts (NEW)

**Files Modified**:
- lib/ai/broker-ai-service.ts (migrate state logic)
- lib/integrations/chatwoot-client.ts (use state manager)

---

### Decision 4: Memory Architecture
**PATH**: Redis + Supabase tiered storage

**RATIONALE**:
- Redis: Sub-millisecond access for active conversations (24-hour retention)
- Supabase: Permanent history for analytics and compliance
- Write-through cache pattern for consistency

**ACTION**: Implement tiered storage with automatic cache warming

**Files Created**:
- lib/ai/conversation-memory.ts (NEW)

---

### Decision 5: AI Model Selection
**PATH**: Multi-model orchestration with intent router

**RATIONALE**:
- 83% cost reduction vs. GPT-4 only
- Right-sized models for task complexity
- Intent router classifies conversation turn and routes to appropriate model
- Fallback to GPT-4 for ambiguous cases

**ACTION**: Implement intent-based routing with model degradation

**Files Created**:
- lib/ai/intent-router.ts (NEW)
- lib/ai/multi-model-orchestrator.ts (NEW)

**Success Metrics**:
- Classification accuracy: >95%
- Average cost per conversation: <$0.10
- Response quality score: >4.5/5


### Decision 6: Context Window Management
**PATH**: Sliding window with semantic compression

**RATIONALE**:
- GPT-4 context limit: 128K tokens
- Average conversation: 15-25 turns = ~8K tokens
- Risk: Long conversations exceed limit
- Solution: Compress older turns while preserving key information

**Compression Strategy**:
1. Keep last 10 turns verbatim (recency bias)
2. Summarize turns 11-20 (semantic compression)
3. Extract key facts from turns 21+ (fact extraction)

**Files Created**:
- lib/ai/context-compressor.ts (NEW)

---

### Decision 7: Error Handling & Fallbacks
**PATH**: Graceful degradation with user-visible fallbacks

**RATIONALE**:
- AI failures should not break conversation flow
- User trust depends on reliable responses

**Degradation Hierarchy**:
1. Primary: Multi-model orchestrator
2. Fallback 1: GPT-3.5-turbo (fast, cheap)
3. Fallback 2: Template-based responses
4. Fallback 3: "Connect to human broker" handoff

**Files Modified**:
- lib/ai/broker-ai-service.ts (add fallback logic)

---

### Decision 8: Logging & Observability
**PATH**: Structured logging with conversation tracing

**RATIONALE**:
- Current logging: Ad-hoc console.log statements
- Need: Structured logs for debugging, analytics, compliance
- Requirement: Trace full conversation flow across services

**Implementation**:
- Use Winston for structured logging
- Store logs in Supabase for analytics
- Real-time monitoring with Vercel Analytics

**Files Created**:
- lib/utils/conversation-logger.ts (NEW)

---

### Decision 9: Testing Strategy
**PATH**: Multi-layer testing with conversation replay

**Testing Layers**:

1. Unit Tests (Deterministic components)
2. Integration Tests (Service interactions)
3. Conversation Replay Tests (AI behavior - record 50 real conversations and replay)
4. Load Tests (100 concurrent conversations, response time <2s p95)

**Files Created**:
- tests/integration/conversation-replay.test.ts (NEW)
- tests/load/concurrent-conversations.test.ts (NEW)

---

### Decision 10: Feature Flags
**PATH**: LaunchDarkly-style feature flags for progressive rollout

**RATIONALE**:
- High-risk changes require gradual rollout
- Need ability to rollback without deployment

**Flags**:
- ai-multi-model: Multi-model orchestration
- ai-context-compression: Context window management
- ai-intent-routing: Intent-based model selection
- calculation-fixes: Dr. Elena fixes
- tiered-memory: Redis + Supabase storage

**Rollout Strategy**:
1. Week 1: Internal testing (10% of conversations)
2. Week 2: Beta users (25% of conversations)
3. Week 3: General availability (100% of conversations)

**Files Created**:
- lib/utils/feature-flags.ts (NEW)

---

### Decision 11: Performance Optimization
**PATH**: Parallel processing + caching

**RATIONALE**:
- Current: Sequential API calls (600-800ms latency)
- Target: <2s response time (p95)

**Optimizations**:
1. Parallel Intent Classification + Context Loading
2. Response Streaming (for long responses)
3. Precompute Common Explanations (cache frequently asked questions)

**Files Modified**:
- lib/ai/broker-ai-service.ts (add parallel processing)

---

### Decision 12: Compliance & Data Privacy
**PATH**: PDPA-compliant conversation storage with PII masking

**RATIONALE**:
- Singapore PDPA requirements:
  - User consent for data collection
  - Right to deletion (forget me)
  - PII protection in logs

**Implementation**:
1. PII Masking in Logs (credit cards, NRIC, phone numbers)
2. Conversation Deletion (Redis + Supabase)
3. Consent Management (checkbox in mortgage form)

**Files Created**:
- lib/security/pii-masker.ts (NEW)
- lib/security/consent-manager.ts (NEW)

---

## Conflict Resolutions

### Conflict 1: broker-ai-service.ts Model Selection
**Conflict**: Three different model selection approaches proposed
1. Plan A: Always use GPT-4 (expensive, $30/1M tokens)
2. Plan B: Always use GPT-3.5-turbo (cheap, low quality)
3. Plan C: Multi-model orchestration (complex)

**Resolution**: Feature-flagged multi-model with backward compatibility

**Implementation**: Feature flag 'ai-multi-model' controls model selection. When disabled, reverts to GPT-4-turbo. When enabled, uses intent-based routing.

**Rollback Safety**: Disable ai-multi-model flag for instant revert to GPT-4

---

### Conflict 2: chatwoot-client.ts Greeting Logic
**Conflict**: Two approaches to conversation greetings
1. Plan A: AI-generated personalized greetings (slow, 800ms)
2. Plan B: Template-based greetings (fast, 50ms, generic)

**Resolution**: Enhance templates with AI, keep fallback

**Implementation**: Try AI enhancement with 500ms timeout. If timeout or error, use template greeting.

**Benefits**:
- Fast path: Template (50ms)
- Enhanced path: AI (500ms, with timeout)
- Zero downtime: Always has fallback

---

### Conflict 3: Dr. Elena Calculation Discrepancies
**Conflict**: Three critical bugs in lib/calculations/mortgage.ts
1. MSR Property Type Check (Line 550-556): Missing validation
2. Income Recognition Multipliers: Not implemented
3. Stress Test Rate Enforcement: Inconsistent (60% vs 100%)

**Resolution**: Fix in place with targeted patches

**Fix 1: MSR Property Type Check** (7 lines)
- Add property type parameter to calculateMSR function
- Apply MAS guidelines: HDB = 30% limit, Private = 35% limit
- Throw MSRExceededError if limit exceeded

**Fix 2: Income Recognition Multipliers** (15 lines)
- Self-employed: 70% income recognition (MAS Notice 632)
- Commission-based: 70% income recognition
- Rental income: 70% income recognition (after expenses)

**Fix 3: Stress Test Rate Enforcement** (3 lines)
- Add +0.5% buffer to stress test rate (MAS requirement)
- Change from 60% enforcement to 100% enforcement

**Testing Requirements**:
- Regression tests: All existing calculations still pass
- New tests: Each fix validated against MAS guidelines
- Integration tests: AI explanations reflect corrected calculations
