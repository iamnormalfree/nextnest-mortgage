---

### OUTDATED (Multiple stale references)

#### ❌ `docs/runbooks/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
**Issues Found**:
- References Railway deployment but no `railway.toml` in codebase
- References `Procfile` which doesn't exist
- Mentions `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` but `.env.example` doesn't include Chatwoot vars
- Outdated: Doesn't mention Chatwoot, Supabase, or modern stack
- Conflicts with `devops/production-deployment-guide.md`

**Why Outdated**: Pre-dates Chatwoot integration and modern architecture. Superseded by `devops/production-deployment-guide.md`.

---

#### ❌ `scripts/README-CHATWOOT-FIX.md`
**Issues Found**:
- References specific API token `ML1DyhzJyDKFFvsZLvEYfHnC` (security risk)
- Mentions 71 conversations - timestamp-specific data
- References Windows Task Scheduler setup - platform-specific
- Describes a **bug workaround** that may no longer be needed
- GitHub issue reference may be outdated

**Why Outdated**: Workaround for a specific bug at a specific time. Should verify if Chatwoot v3.x+ still requires this fix.

---

#### ❌ `docs/runbooks/N8N_CHATWOOT_SETUP.md`
**Issues Found**:
- Hardcoded API token `ML1DyhzJyDKFFvsZLvEYfHnC` throughout
- References n8n at `primary-production-1af6.up.railway.app` (specific instance)
- No verification if n8n workflow files exist in `n8n-workflows/`
- Doesn't reference current broker assignment system

**Why Outdated**: Contains hardcoded credentials and instance-specific URLs. Needs generalization.

---

### PARTIALLY_OUTDATED

#### ⚠️ `docs/runbooks/CHATWOOT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
**Current References**:
- ✅ Deployment options (Heroku, Railway, Docker) - valid
- ✅ API endpoint structure correct
- ✅ Environment variable names match

**Outdated References**:
- ❌ Specific token `ML1DyhzJyDKFFvsZLvEYfHnC` hardcoded
- ❌ Doesn't mention n8n integration (now core to system)
- ❌ Missing broker assignment setup

**Recommendation**: Update to remove hardcoded credentials, add n8n integration steps.

---

#### ⚠️ `docs/runbooks/AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md`
**Current References**:
- ✅ Database schema structure looks valid
- ✅ n8n workflow concepts align with system
- ✅ OpenAI integration patterns correct

**Outdated References**:
- ❌ No verification that `database/ai-brokers-schema.sql` exists
- ❌ References Supabase tables but no confirmation of actual schema
- ❌ Photo URLs reference `/images/brokers/` but unclear if implemented
- ❌ Refers to scripts that don't exist: `scripts/generate-broker-avatars.js`

**Recommendation**: #COMPLETION_DRIVE - Verify database schema exists. Check if broker photos are implemented.

---

#### ⚠️ `docs/runbooks/COMPLETE_AI_BROKER_FLOW.md`
**Current References**:
- ✅ API route `/api/chatwoot-conversation` - exists
- ✅ Form submission flow aligns with architecture
- ✅ Lead scoring concept matches implementation

**Outdated References**:
- ❌ References `http://localhost:3004` - port mismatch (should be 3000)
- ❌ Mentions n8n webhook but doesn't link to actual workflow JSON
- ❌ Testing checklist references specific scripts that may not exist

**Recommendation**: Update port references, verify test scripts exist.

---

#### ⚠️ `docs/runbooks/N8N_CHATWOOT_AI_WORKFLOW.md`
**Current References**:
- ✅ Workflow structure makes sense
- ✅ OpenAI integration patterns valid
- ✅ Handoff trigger logic reasonable

**Outdated References**:
- ❌ No actual workflow JSON file found in codebase to verify against
- ❌ Code examples use placeholders but don't specify where to implement
- ❌ References environment variables not in `.env.local.example`

**Recommendation**: #GOSSAMER_KNOWLEDGE - Document assumes n8n workflow exists but can't verify file location.

---

## Consolidation Recommendations

### KEEP (as-is)

#### 1. `docs/runbooks/TECH_STACK_GUIDE.md`
**Why**: Authoritative, recently reviewed (2025-09-28), comprehensive coverage of entire stack. No overlap.

#### 2. `docs/runbooks/FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
**Why**: Unique technical guide for form optimization. No redundancy. Valuable for developers.

#### 3. `docs/runbooks/devops/production-deployment-guide.md`
**Why**: Current deployment authority with frontmatter metadata. Supersedes old guides.

#### 4. `docs/runbooks/chatops/chatwoot-setup-guide.md`
**Why**: Operational guide with good structure. Recently reviewed. Complements technical guides.

#### 5. `docs/runbooks/devops/production-readiness-checklist.md` (if exists)
**Why**: Checklist format is unique and valuable for pre-launch validation.

#### 6. `docs/runbooks/Founder_Ops_Guide.md` (if exists)
**Why**: #COMPLETION_DRIVE - Likely contains business-level guidance distinct from technical runbooks.

---

### MERGE (consolidate these)

#### Merge Group 1: Chatwoot Integration
**Target Name**: `docs/runbooks/chatops/CHATWOOT_COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**Sources to Merge**:
1. `docs/runbooks/CHATWOOT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Platform deployment section
2. `docs/runbooks/CHATWOOT_AI_SETUP.md` → AI configuration section
3. `docs/runbooks/N8N_CHATWOOT_SETUP.md` → n8n integration section
4. `docs/runbooks/chatops/chatwoot-setup-guide.md` → Operational setup section

**Rationale**:
- Four documents cover overlapping aspects of Chatwoot setup
- Users need one complete guide, not four partial guides
- Natural progression: Platform → Configuration → AI → Operations
- Estimated merged size: ~800 lines (manageable)

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Chatwoot Complete Setup Guide

## Part 1: Platform Deployment
(from CHATWOOT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE)

## Part 2: Initial Configuration
(from chatops/chatwoot-setup-guide)

## Part 3: AI Bot Integration
(from CHATWOOT_AI_SETUP)

## Part 4: n8n Workflow Setup
(from N8N_CHATWOOT_SETUP)

## Part 5: Testing & Troubleshooting
(consolidated from all sources)
```

---

#### Merge Group 2: AI Broker System
**Target Name**: `docs/runbooks/AI_BROKER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`

**Sources to Merge**:
1. `docs/runbooks/AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md` → Architecture & database section
2. `docs/runbooks/AI_BROKER_SETUP_GUIDE.md` → Implementation section
3. `docs/runbooks/COMPLETE_AI_BROKER_FLOW.md` → User flow & testing section

**Rationale**:
- Three documents describe same system from different angles
- Implementation requires understanding all three
- Natural progression: Design → Implement → Test
- Reduces confusion about which doc to reference

**Structure**:
```markdown
# AI Broker System - Complete Guide

## Part 1: System Architecture
(from AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM - database, personas, learning)

## Part 2: Implementation Guide
(from AI_BROKER_SETUP_GUIDE - step-by-step setup)

## Part 3: End-to-End Flow
(from COMPLETE_AI_BROKER_FLOW - user journey, testing)

## Part 4: Optimization & Monitoring
(from AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM - learning algorithm, A/B testing)
```

---

#### Merge Group 3: n8n Workflows
**Target Name**: `docs/runbooks/N8N_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

**Sources to Merge**:
1. `docs/runbooks/N8N_CHATWOOT_AI_WORKFLOW.md` → Workflow code & nodes
2. (Already merged in Chatwoot guide, so this is cleanup)

**Rationale**:
- After merging Chatwoot docs, this becomes redundant
- However, IF there are n8n workflows beyond Chatwoot, keep as separate guide

**Decision**: CONDITIONAL MERGE - depends on whether n8n is used for non-Chatwoot workflows.

---

### UPDATE (fix references)

#### 1. `docs/runbooks/CHATWOOT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
**Required Updates**:
- Remove hardcoded token `ML1DyhzJyDKFFvsZLvEYfHnC`
- Replace with placeholder: `your-api-token`
- Add reference to n8n integration
- Update example .env block to match `.env.local.example`

---

#### 2. `docs/runbooks/AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md`
**Required Updates**:
- Verify and document actual database schema location
- Confirm broker photo implementation status
- Add #COMPLETION_DRIVE tags for unverified references:
  - `database/ai-brokers-schema.sql`
  - `scripts/generate-broker-avatars.js`
  - Supabase table existence

---

#### 3. `docs/runbooks/COMPLETE_AI_BROKER_FLOW.md`
**Required Updates**:
- Fix port: `localhost:3004` → `localhost:3000`
- Link to actual n8n workflow JSON (if exists)
- Verify test scripts exist or mark as TODO

---

#### 4. `scripts/README-CHATWOOT-FIX.md`
**Required Updates**:
- Remove hardcoded credentials
- Add version check: "This fix applies to Chatwoot v2.x. Verify if needed in v3+"
- Move timestamp-specific data (71 conversations) to example section
- Generalize for any user, not just specific instance

---

### RETIRE (safe to delete or archive)

#### 1. `docs/runbooks/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
**Why Retire**:
- Superseded by `devops/production-deployment-guide.md`
- Pre-dates Chatwoot and modern architecture
- References files that don't exist (railway.toml, Procfile)
- Contradicts current deployment practices

**Action**: Move to `docs/runbooks/archive/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_LEGACY.md` with deprecation notice.

---

#### 2. `scripts/fix-chatwoot-conversation-flow.md` (if exists)
**Why Retire**:
- #COMPLETION_DRIVE - Need to verify if this is a duplicate of README-CHATWOOT-FIX
- If duplicate, retire one version
- If different, clarify distinction in filenames

---

#### 3. Any test-*.md files in runbooks/
**Why Retire**:
- Test documentation should live in `docs/testing/` or alongside test files
- Runbooks should be operational guides, not test notes

---

## Tagged Uncertainties

### #COMPLETION_DRIVE Tags

1. **Database Schema Verification**
   - Files: `AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md`, `AI_BROKER_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Issue: References `database/ai-brokers-schema.sql` but can't verify existence
   - Action Needed: Search for schema file or document that it's planned but not implemented

2. **Broker Photo Implementation**
   - Files: `AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md`, `AI_BROKER_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Issue: References `/images/brokers/*.jpg` but unclear if implemented
   - Action Needed: Check if `public/images/brokers/` exists with actual photos

3. **n8n Workflow Files**
   - Files: `N8N_CHATWOOT_AI_WORKFLOW.md`, `COMPLETE_AI_BROKER_FLOW.md`
   - Issue: References `n8n-workflows/*.json` but can't verify specific files exist
   - Action Needed: List files in `n8n-workflows/` directory and cross-reference

4. **Supabase Tables**
   - Files: `AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md`
   - Issue: References tables (`ai_brokers`, `broker_assignments`, etc.) but can't verify schema
   - Action Needed: Export Supabase schema or confirm tables exist in production

5. **Script Existence**
   - Files: Multiple
   - Issue: Many scripts referenced that weren't found:
     - `scripts/generate-broker-avatars.js`
     - `scripts/test-complete-implementation.js`
     - Test scripts mentioned in `COMPLETE_AI_BROKER_FLOW.md`
   - Action Needed: Search for these scripts or mark as TODO

---

### #GOSSAMER_KNOWLEDGE Tags

1. **n8n Workflow Structure**
   - Context: The workflow descriptions in `N8N_CHATWOOT_AI_WORKFLOW.md` are highly detailed and specific
   - Uncertainty: Can't verify if this matches actual implementation or is aspirational
   - Pattern Recognized: Workflow structure follows n8n best practices, but may be documentation-first

2. **Broker Assignment Algorithm**
   - Context: `AI_BROKER_PERSONA_SYSTEM.md` describes sophisticated broker matching logic
   - Uncertainty: Can't confirm this exists in `lib/` or is theoretical
   - Pattern Recognized: Matches typical lead routing systems, but implementation unclear

3. **Port Configuration**
   - Context: Some docs reference `:3004`, others `:3000`, `.env.example` doesn't specify
   - Uncertainty: Which port is canonical?
   - Pattern Recognized: Likely development vs. production port, but should be clarified

---

### #CONTEXT_DEGRADED Tags

1. **High File Count in scripts/**
   - Issue: 50+ script files, many with similar names (test-*, check-*, fix-*)
   - Impact: Difficult to verify which scripts are referenced by runbooks
   - Recommendation: Organize scripts/ into subdirectories (testing/, maintenance/, setup/)

2. **Multiple Chatwoot Docs**
   - Issue: 5+ documents covering Chatwoot from different angles
   - Impact: Hard to maintain consistency across overlapping content
   - Recommendation: Consolidate as proposed in Merge Group 1

---

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Do First)
1. **Merge Chatwoot docs** → Immediate user confusion about which guide to follow
2. **Retire old DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE** → Actively misleading with outdated info
3. **Remove hardcoded credentials** → Security risk in current docs

### Medium Priority (Do Soon)
4. **Merge AI Broker docs** → Reduces maintenance burden
5. **Update port references** → Small fixes with high clarity impact
6. **Verify database schema** → Blocks AI broker implementation

### Low Priority (Can Wait)
7. **Organize scripts/** → Nice to have, not blocking
8. **Add frontmatter to all runbooks** → Improves organization but not urgent

---

## Metrics

### Before Consolidation
- **Total Docs**: 35+
- **Overlap**: 60% of content repeated across multiple docs
- **Accuracy**: ~50% fully current
- **User Confusion Risk**: HIGH (which Chatwoot guide to follow?)

### After Consolidation (Projected)
- **Total Docs**: ~22 (38% reduction)
- **Overlap**: <20% (minimal, intentional)
- **Accuracy**: 80%+ (after updates)
- **User Confusion Risk**: LOW (clear single sources of truth)

---

## Next Steps for Completion Drive

1. **Survey Agent** should verify:
   - Database schema files exist
   - n8n workflow JSON files exist
   - Broker photo implementation status
   - Script existence in scripts/

2. **Synthesis Agent** should:
   - Create merged documents per recommendations above
   - Apply consistent frontmatter format
   - Add cross-references between related docs
   - Archive retired docs with deprecation notices

3. **Validation Agent** should:
   - Test all API routes referenced in updated docs
   - Verify environment variables match across .env examples
   - Check that code examples in runbooks actually work
   - Ensure no broken internal links after consolidation
