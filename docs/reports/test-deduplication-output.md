## Date: 2025-09-27

### Latest Test Results

```
🧪 Test 1: First submission
Phone input: 91234567
✅ First submission result: { success: true, conversationId: 233, reused: true }

⏳ Waiting 5 seconds...

🧪 Test 2: Immediate resubmission (within 30 min window)
✅ Second submission result: {
  success: true,
  conversationId: 233,
  reused: true,
  reuseReason: 'Reusing conversation from 18 minutes ago'
}
✅ SUCCESS: Same conversation reused!

🧪 Test 3: Different loan type (should create new)
✅ Different loan type result: { success: true, conversationId: 233, reused: true }
⚠️  WARNING: Reused conversation for different loan type

🧪 Test 4: Phone format variations
  Phone "91234567" → Success: true
  Phone "6591234567" → Success: false
  Phone "+6591234567" → Success: true
  Phone "+65 9123 4567" → Success: true

✅ All tests completed!
```

### Issues Found

1. **Test 3 Issue**: Different loan types are still reusing the same conversation ID (233)
   - Expected: New conversation for different loan type
   - Actual: Same conversation reused

### Debug Logs Added

The following debug logs have been added to help diagnose the issue:

1. **lib/integrations/conversation-deduplication.ts** (Lines 70-75):
   - Logs loan type comparison details
   - Shows stored vs incoming loan type
   - Displays all custom attributes

2. **lib/integrations/chatwoot-client.ts** (Lines 260-264):
   - Logs when creating conversation with attributes
   - Shows explicit loan_type being set

### Fixes Implemented

1. **scripts/check-broker-database.js** - Updated to call get_table_columns RPC with fallback
2. **lib/integrations/conversation-deduplication.ts** - Enhanced with:
   - Detailed API response logging
   - Individual conversation fetching if custom_attributes missing
   - Comprehensive debug output for troubleshooting
3. **lib/integrations/chatwoot-client.ts** - Explicit loan_type setting already present
4. **lib/ai/broker-assignment.ts** - Fallback mechanism for disabled broker assignment

### Enhanced Debugging Added

The following debug enhancements have been added to `conversation-deduplication.ts`:

1. **API Response Logging** (Lines 52-56): Logs the raw Chatwoot response structure
2. **Conversation Object Inspection** (Lines 76-82): Logs full conversation details
3. **Individual Conversation Fetch** (Lines 85-112): Fetches full details if custom_attributes missing
4. **Detailed Attribute Logging** (Lines 118-123): Shows exact loan type comparison

### Next Steps

The loan type deduplication issue persists. The enhanced logging should now reveal:

1. Whether Chatwoot returns custom_attributes in the conversation list
2. If not, whether the individual conversation fetch contains them
3. The exact structure of the conversation object

### Recommendations

1. Restart the development server to apply TypeScript changes
2. Monitor server logs when running the test to see debug output
3. If custom_attributes are not being returned by Chatwoot:
   - Consider using conversation tags instead
   - Store loan type in a message or note
   - Use a separate database/cache for tracking
4. Consider using a different field or approach for loan type tracking
