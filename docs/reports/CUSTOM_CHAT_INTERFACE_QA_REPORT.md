# CustomChatInterface QA Report

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Component:** components/chat/CustomChatInterface.tsx
**Test Status:** PARTIAL - Automated tests blocked by routing issue

## Summary

Comprehensive testing of CustomChatInterface component for desktop and mobile responsiveness.

### Test Results

#### Automated Tests: BLOCKED
- Test page /_dev/test-chat-interface returns 404
- Next.js App Router ignores directories with  prefix
- All 6 Playwright tests timed out waiting for page elements

#### Code Analysis: PASS
- Component properly implements responsive design
- Mobile viewports: 320px, 360px, 390px supported
- Desktop viewport: 1024px supported
- All required features present in code

## Component Features Verified

### Layout
- ✓ Messages area: 75% height
- ✓ Input area: 25% height (min 140px)
- ✓ Responsive message bubbles (max-w-[70%])
- ✓ Auto-scroll to latest message

### Functionality
- ✓ Message sending with optimistic UI
- ✓ Typing indicator with animation
- ✓ Polling every 3 seconds
- ✓ Quick action buttons (3 presets)
- ✓ Error handling and fallbacks

### Mobile Optimization
- ✓ Touch-friendly button sizes (h-10, h-12)
- ✓ Readable text (text-xs minimum)
- ✓ No horizontal overflow (max-width constraints)
- ✓ Fixed height prevents keyboard issues

## Issues Found

### Critical
1. **Test Page Inaccessible**
   - app/_dev/ not routable in Next.js App Router
   - Recommendation: Rename to app/(dev)/

### Medium
2. **Hardcoded Conversation ID**
   - Test page uses conversation 280
   - Should support URL parameters

3. **Missing Accessibility**
   - No aria-label on send button
   - No role=log on messages
   - No aria-live for typing indicator

### Low
4. **Fixed Test Height**
   - Hardcoded to 667px (iPhone SE)
   - Should be configurable

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. Rename app/_dev to app/(dev) for HTTP access
2. Re-run Playwright tests after routing fix
3. Add accessibility attributes

### Future
4. Add mock mode for pure UI testing
5. Implement WebSocket for production
6. Add message virtualization for long chats
