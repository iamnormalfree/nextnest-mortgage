# UX Improvements - Step 3 Implementation Session
**Date**: September 5, 2025
**Session Focus**: Step 3 Field Simplification & UI/UX Improvements

---

## üéØ SESSION OBJECTIVES
Implement UX improvements for Step 3 of the mortgage form based on RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md requirements:
- Simplify credit card dropdown from ranges to individual counts
- Redesign applicant information layout with co-applicant toggle
- Standardize placeholder text
- Simplify employment status dropdown

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Credit Card Dropdown Enhancement
**Previous State**: 
- Range-based options: "1-2 cards", "3-5 cards", "6+ cards"
- Unclear TDSR impact

**Implemented Changes**:
- Individual count options: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cards
- Each card adds $50/month to TDSR calculations
- Moved field below Monthly Commitments
- Marked as "(Optional)" field
- Added helper text: "Each card adds $50/month to TDSR calculations"

**Files Modified**:
- `components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx` - Updated dropdown options
- `lib/validation/mortgage-schemas.ts` - Updated enum values
- `lib/calculations/mortgage.ts` - Added `getCreditCardCommitment()` function

### 2. Applicant Information Redesign
**Previous State**:
- Separate grid layout for ages and incomes
- Always showed both applicant fields
- No easy way to toggle co-applicant

**Implemented Changes**:
- Side-by-side layout (Age | Monthly Income)
- Added "Add/Remove Co-applicant" toggle button with +/- icon
- Main applicant always visible
- Co-applicant fields appear below with smooth animation
- Clear co-applicant data when removing (sets to 0)
- Better visual hierarchy with smaller labels

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
actualAges[0] = Main applicant age
actualAges[1] = Co-applicant age (when present)
actualIncomes[0] = Main applicant income  
actualIncomes[1] = Co-applicant income (when present)
```

**Bug Fix**: Added `setValue` to useForm destructuring to fix runtime error

### 3. Placeholder Standardization
**Previous State**:
- Inconsistent placeholders: "Applicant 1 Age", "8,000", "5,000"

**Implemented Changes**:
- Standardized format with "e.g.," prefix:
  - Main applicant age: "e.g., 35"
  - Main applicant income: "e.g., 5,000"
  - Co-applicant age: "e.g., 32"
  - Co-applicant income: "e.g., 3,500"
- Provides clear example values for users

### 4. Employment Status Simplification
**Previous State**:
- 4 options: Employed (Full-time), Self-employed, Contract/Freelance, Business Owner
- No guidance on documentation requirements

**Implemented Changes**:
- Simplified to 3 options:
  - Employed (stable)
  - Self-Employed/Contractor
  - Recently Changed Job
- Added conditional helper messages:
  - Recently Changed: "Will need 3 months payslips or employment letter"
  - Self-Employed: "Will need 2 years NOA (Notice of Assessment)"
- Messages appear in amber background for visibility
- Default helper text when no selection made

---

## üìù FIELD ORDER IN STEP 3 (NEW PURCHASE)
1. **Applicant Information** 
   - Main applicant (Age | Income) - always visible
   - Co-applicant toggle button
   - Co-applicant (Age | Income) - conditional
   
2. **Monthly Commitments** (Optional)
   - For existing loans (car, student, etc.)
   
3. **Credit Card Count** (Optional)
   - Dropdown with 0-5 options
   - $50/month per card for TDSR
   
4. **Employment Status**
   - 3 simplified options
   - Conditional documentation guidance

---

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Key Functions Added:
```typescript
// Credit card TDSR calculation
export function getCreditCardCommitment(cardCount: string | number): number {
  const count = typeof cardCount === 'string' ? parseInt(cardCount) : cardCount
  return isNaN(count) ? 0 : count * 50 // $50 per card per month
}
```

### Validation Schema Updates:
```typescript
creditCardCount: z.enum(['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5'], {
  message: 'Please select your credit card count'
}).optional()
```

### Co-applicant Toggle Logic:
```typescript
// Clear co-applicant data when removing
if (newType === 'single') {
  setValue('actualAges.1', 0)
  setValue('actualIncomes.1', 0)
  handleFieldChange('actualAges.1', 0)
  handleFieldChange('actualIncomes.1', 0)
}
```

## üìä UX IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED
- **Cleaner Layout**: Side-by-side fields reduce vertical scrolling
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Co-applicant only shown when needed
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Plus/minus icons for add/remove actions
- **Better TDSR Transparency**: Shows exact $50/month impact per card
- **Guided Experience**: Conditional help text based on selections
- **Consistent Examples**: Standardized placeholder format

---

## üìö DOCUMENTATION UPDATED
- `remap-ux/RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md` - Updated task statuses and requirements
- `remap-ux/JUNIOR_DEV_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Updated with correct examples

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è COMPLIANCE WITH RECONCILIATION PLAN
All changes align with the reconciliation plan's core principles:
- ‚úÖ Maximum 5 fields in Step 3
- ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure at STEP level (not field level)
- ‚úÖ Credit cards: Individual count √ó $50/month for TDSR
- ‚úÖ Employment: 3 simple categories
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly controls
- ‚úÖ Clear optional field marking

---

## üêõ ISSUES RESOLVED
1. **Runtime Error**: Fixed "setValue is not defined" by adding to useForm destructuring
2. **Field Structure**: Properly structured credit card field moved after monthly commitments
3. **Data Clearing**: Co-applicant data now properly clears when toggled off

---

## üí° KEY DECISIONS MADE
1. Used 0 instead of undefined when clearing co-applicant data (avoids TypeScript errors)
2. Placed credit card field after monthly commitments for logical flow
3. Used amber background for conditional help messages (better visibility)
4. Kept "employmentType" as field name for backward compatibility

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (If Needed)
- [ ] Implement IWAA calculation using actual ages and incomes
- [ ] Add refined calculation display in Step 3
- [ ] Implement eligibility status display
- [ ] Add mobile-specific optimizations if required

---

## üìå SESSION SUMMARY
Successfully implemented all requested Step 3 improvements following the RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md guidelines. The form now has:
- Cleaner, more intuitive UI with side-by-side applicant fields
- Smart co-applicant toggle with data management
- Transparent TDSR calculations for credit cards
- Simplified employment status with helpful guidance
- Consistent placeholder text throughout

All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience.
