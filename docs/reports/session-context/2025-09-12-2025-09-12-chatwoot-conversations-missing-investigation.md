# Chatwoot Conversations Missing Investigation
**Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Session:** Investigating why test conversations don't appear in chat.nextnest.sg dashboard

## Problem Statement
User reported that test conversations created through the NextNest form are not appearing in the Chatwoot dashboard at chat.nextnest.sg, despite the system appearing to work correctly.

## Investigation Findings

### ‚úÖ **Conversations ARE Being Created Successfully**
From the server logs, I can confirm:

1. **Conversations Created:** Multiple conversations were successfully created (IDs: 68, 69, etc.)
2. **Broker Assignment Working:** Jasmine Lee broker was properly assigned 
3. **Initial Messages Sent:** Welcome messages were sent successfully
4. **User Messages Received:** User sent "hi Jasmine" and received responses
5. **n8n Integration Active:** Webhooks forwarding to n8n AI broker workflow

### üîß **System Working Correctly**
Evidence from logs:
```
‚úÖ Chatwoot conversation created: 68
‚úÖ Chatwoot conversation created: 69
‚úÖ Broker assigned successfully: Jasmine Lee
‚úÖ DEBUG: Initial message sent successfully with broker: Jasmine Lee
‚úÖ n8n processed successfully: { message: 'Workflow was started' }
```

### üö® **Connection Issues Identified**
The logs show connection timeout errors:
```
Error fetching messages: TypeError: fetch failed
ConnectTimeoutError: Connect Timeout Error (attempted address: chat.nextnest.sg:443, timeout: 10000ms)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Issues:

1. **Network Connectivity Problem**
   - The NextNest application can CREATE conversations via Chatwoot API
   - But there may be intermittent connectivity issues preventing consistent access
   - Timeout errors suggest network latency or connection drops

2. **Dashboard View/Filter Issues** 
   - Conversations might exist but not be visible due to:
     - Wrong inbox view selected
     - Status filters (pending vs resolved)
     - Date range filters
     - User assignment filters

3. **Webhook/Real-time Updates**
   - Conversations created but dashboard not refreshing
   - Browser caching issues
   - WebSocket connection problems

## Configuration Verified ‚úÖ

```env
CHATWOOT_BASE_URL=https://chat.nextnest.sg
CHATWOOT_API_TOKEN=ML1DyhzJyDKFFvsZLvEYfHnC
CHATWOOT_ACCOUNT_ID=1
CHATWOOT_INBOX_ID=1
CHATWOOT_WEBSITE_TOKEN=SBSfsRrvWSyzfVUXv7QKjoa2
```

## Test Results

### Recent Test Conversation (2025-09-12 12:10)
- **Session ID:** session_1757678979566_hwhf5nxce
- **User Name:** Brent  
- **Lead Score:** 100
- **Loan Type:** new_purchase
- **Conversation IDs:** 68, 69
- **Broker Assigned:** Jasmine Lee
- **Status:** Conversations created and active

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Steps:
1. **Check Chatwoot Dashboard Filters**
   - Verify "All Conversations" view is selected
   - Check if "Pending" or "Open" status filter is applied
   - Ensure correct date range is selected
   - Verify inbox selection (should be Inbox ID: 1)

2. **Manual Conversation Lookup**
   - Search for conversation IDs: 68, 69 directly in Chatwoot
   - Search for contact "Brent" or email used in form
   - Check "All" status instead of just "Open"

3. **Browser/Cache Issues**
   - Hard refresh Chatwoot dashboard (Ctrl+F5)
   - Try different browser or incognito mode
   - Clear browser cache for chat.nextnest.sg

### Technical Investigation:
1. **API Direct Test**
   - Test Chatwoot API directly to verify conversations exist
   - Check conversation status and metadata
   - Verify webhook subscriptions are active

2. **Network Connectivity**
   - Monitor for consistent connection to chat.nextnest.sg
   - Check for any firewall/proxy issues
   - Verify SSL certificate validity

## Files Modified
- None (investigation only)

## Next Session Tasks
1. Test direct Chatwoot API calls to verify conversations exist
2. Check dashboard filtering and view settings
3. Implement connection retry logic if needed
4. Add conversation lookup debugging tools

- ‚úÖ Conversation creation working  
- ‚úÖ Broker assignment working
