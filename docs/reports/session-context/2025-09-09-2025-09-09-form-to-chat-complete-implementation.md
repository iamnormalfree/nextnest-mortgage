## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### 1. Data Flow
```
User Form → Data Sanitization → API Validation → Chatwoot Creation → Chat Widget Load
                ↓                     ↓                ↓
           Audit Logger         Circuit Breaker    AI Context Injection
```

### 2. Security Layers
- **Input Layer**: Sanitization, PII detection, validation
- **Processing Layer**: Encryption, audit logging, consent tracking
- **Output Layer**: PII redaction, secure transmission
- **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time compliance dashboard

### 3. AI Broker Personas
- **Marcus Chen** (Aggressive): Premium rates, high urgency, FOMO tactics
- **Sarah Wong** (Balanced): Educational, consultative, trust-building
- **David Lim** (Conservative): Patient, supportive, no-pressure
