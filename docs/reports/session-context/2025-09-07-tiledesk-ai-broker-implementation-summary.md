## üîÑ **Implementation Approach Evolution**

### **Initial Plan:** Server-Side API Integration
- Use REST API with JWT authentication
- Server creates conversations
- Complex authentication flow

### **Problem Encountered:**
- Self-hosted Tiledesk auth endpoints returned 405 errors
- API authentication more complex than cloud version
- Multiple auth endpoint attempts failed

### **Solution Implemented:** Widget-Based Integration
- Client-side Tiledesk widget
- No server authentication required
- Preloading for instant performance
- All form data passed via widget attributes

## üé® **User Experience Flow**

### **Step 0:** Loan Type Selection
- User selects New Purchase/Refinance
- Tiledesk widget script preloads (hidden)

### **Step 1-2:** Form Completion
- User fills out contact and loan details
- Widget continues loading in background

### **Step 3:** Financial Information Complete
- Lead score calculated (0-100)
- Beautiful success animation appears
- Chat invitation card displays with:
  - Animated checkmark
  - Lead score prominently shown
  - Priority status badge
  - Live status indicator (pulsing green dot)
  - Benefits list with checkmarks
  - Prominent CTA button

### **Chat Activation:**
- Click "Start Consultation Now"
- Widget opens instantly (preloaded)
- All form data pre-populated
- Department routing by lead score:
  - 85+: High-value priority
  - 60-84: Standard queue
  - <60: Nurture queue

## üöÄ **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Preloading Strategy:** Widget loads at Step 0, ready by Step 3
2. **Async Loading:** Non-blocking script loading
3. **Instant Opening:** Zero delay when user clicks to chat
4. **Smooth Animations:** CSS animations for professional feel
5. **Mobile Responsive:** Widget adapts to all screen sizes

## üìä **Lead Scoring Integration**

The system automatically calculates lead scores based on:
- Property value and loan amount
