# Session Report: Documentation Overhaul + Phase 1 Planning

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Participants:** Brent (Product Owner) + Claude (Engineer)
**Status:** Mid-conversation - Design specification in progress
**Branch:** `fix/progressive-form-calculation-corrections`

---

## Executive Summary

This session established a complete documentation hierarchy overhaul and clarified Phase 1 scope for NextNest. Key outcome: moved from scattered documentation to a strict 3-tier system with code as canonical truth. Conducted full codebase audit to identify production vs legacy files. Currently paused mid-design-specification after completing Section 1 of multi-section approval process.

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Documentation Hierarchy (3-Tier System)

**Tier 1: Canonical Truth (Actual Code)**

**Design:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\app\redesign\sophisticated-flow\page.tsx`
  - THE production homepage
  - All other `/redesign/*` files are abandoned experiments

**Forms:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\components\forms\ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx` (PRODUCTION)
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\components\forms\ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` (EXISTS - not integrated yet)
- ‚ùå `ProgressiveForm.tsx` (legacy - DELETE)
- ‚ùå `IntelligentMortgageForm.tsx` (old wrapper - DELETE)

**Calculations:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\dr-elena-mortgage-expert-v2.json` (THE source of truth for all constants)
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\calculations\instant-profile.ts` (production, uses v2 JSON)
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\calculations\dr-elena-constants.ts` (extracts from v2 JSON)
- ‚ùå `dr-elena-mortgage.ts` (standalone hardcoded version - not used in main form)
- ‚ùå `dr-elena-mortgage-expert.json` (v1 - old)

**AI Orchestrator:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\ai\ai-orchestrator.ts`

**Queue System:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\queue\broker-queue.ts`
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\queue\broker-worker.ts`
- Note: BullMQ migration (Phase 3) running in parallel with n8n

**Chatwoot Integration:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\app\api\chatwoot-webhook\route.ts`

**Database:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\db\supabase-client.ts`
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\lib\db\types\database.types.ts`

**Tech Stack:**
- `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\package.json`

**Tier 2: Runbooks (Link to Tier 1, Never Duplicate)**

Location: `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\docs\runbooks\`

**Rules:**
- Reference code with line numbers, never copy-paste
- Update links when code moves
- Explain WHY and HOW, not WHAT (code shows WHAT)

**Existing Runbooks (confirmed):**
- `TECH_STACK_GUIDE.md`
- `chatops/CHATWOOT_COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `AI_BROKER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
- `devops/production-deployment-guide.md`
- `FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`

**Tier 3: Plans (Reference Runbooks, <200 Lines)**

**Structure:**
```
docs/plans/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ROADMAP.md (never archived)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backlog/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ descriptive-name.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {year}/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {month}/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
```

**Rules:**
- Max 200 lines (exception: multi-file implementation plans can split into subdirectory)
- Archive when complete (except ROADMAP.md)
- Reference runbooks instead of duplicating

### 2. CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md (Whitelist Approach)

**Purpose:** Claude checks this file before modifying ANY Tier 1 file

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Canonical References

## Allowed Changes
- Fix TypeScript errors
- Add/update ABOUTME comments
- Fix bugs (with test-first approach)

## Forbidden Changes
- Changing formulas/constants
- Modifying colors/design tokens
- Adding/removing dependencies
- Restructuring components

## File-Specific Rules
[Per-file allowlist for each Tier 1 file]
```

**Location:** `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md`

### 3. Product Vision Clarified

**Business Model:** Mortgage advisory firm (NOT lead-gen marketplace)

**Core Strategy:**
- AI broker presells the value of human expertise
- User trusts AI ‚Üí accepts human broker meeting
- Human broker closes the deal

**User Journey:**
1. Smart form (progressive disclosure, instant analysis)
2. Calculated pause ("Analyzing your profile...")
3. Expert matching screen
4. AI broker chat (consultative, builds trust)
5. Human broker handoff (when contextually appropriate)

**Revenue Model:** Commissions from completed mortgages (not lead sales)

### 4. Phase 1 Scope (Weeks 1-6)

**Core Experience:**

**Smart Form:**
- Approach: **B - Smart defaults + conditional fields**
- Mobile-first design
- Progressive disclosure (show fields based on previous answers)
- Instant feedback (validation + helpful hints)
- Smart defaults based on Singapore market norms

**Rate System:**
- Blended approach: Real-time SORA + manual bank packages
- SORA fetched via API (existing implementation)
- Bank packages from `/data/bank-packages/*.md` files (manual update by Brent)
- Display format: Range + specific packages on request

**Calculated Pause:**
- 3-5 second "Analyzing..." screen
- Shows progress indicators
- Builds anticipation for expert matching

**Expert Matching:**
- Show matched AI broker profile
- Brief bio + specialization
- Transition button to chat

**AI Broker Chat:**
- Consultative tone (Jay Abraham "strategy of preeminence")
- Human-like conversation (no visible scoring/urgency)
- Educate and build trust
- Suggest human broker when contextually appropriate
- Behind-the-scenes: rating system determines handoff timing

**Session Persistence:**
- 7-day localStorage via existing `useLoanApplicationStorage`
- Resume from form or chat on return visit
- Clear session on completion or expiry

**Content (10 Pages Total):**
1. Homepage (`/`)
2. Apply page (`/apply`)
3. Chat page (`/chat`)
4. About Us
5. How It Works
6. Privacy Policy
7. Terms of Service
8. Contact
9. FAQ
10. Blog (stub for Phase 2)

**Homepage Features:**
- Live rates card (from `/data/bank-packages/*.md`)
- Hero section with value proposition
- How it works (3-step visual)
- Trust indicators (licenses, testimonials)
- CTA to form

**NO Content Generation in Phase 1:**
- Deferred to Phase 1.5 or Phase 2
- Static pages for now
- Blog stub with placeholder posts

**Performance Targets:**
- <140KB gzipped bundle (calculator portion)
- <3s initial load time
- Route-based code splitting (calculator vs content pages)

### 5. Bank Package Update Workflow

**Manual Process:**

```
C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Code\NextNest\data\bank-packages\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dbs.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ocbc.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uob.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [one file per bank]
```

**Workflow:**
1. Brent updates `.md` file with new rates/packages
2. Pings Claude (or system auto-detects file change)
3. System rebuilds affected pages (ISR in Phase 2)
4. Homepage rates card updates immediately

**Format (per bank):**
```markdown
---
bank: "DBS"
updated: "2025-10-17"
---

## Fixed Rate Packages
- 2-year: 3.25%
- 3-year: 3.15%
- 5-year: 3.05%

## Floating Rate Packages
- SORA + 0.8%
- Board Rate - 1.5%
```

### 6. Architecture Decision: Hybrid Static + ISR (Option B)

**For Phase 2 Content Generation:**

**Static Pages:**
- Guides, articles, evergreen content
- Generated at build time
- Fast, SEO-friendly

**ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):**
- Rate-dependent pages (homepage rates card)
- Blog posts with rate mentions
- Rebuild on-demand when bank packages update

**Route-Based Code Splitting:**
- Calculator bundle: `/apply` + `/chat` routes
- Content bundle: `/blog`, `/guides` routes
- Shared bundle: common components, utilities

**Benefits:**
- Keeps calculator bundle <140KB
- Scales content without bloating core experience
- Fast initial load for form users

### 7. Single Responsive Form Strategy (CRITICAL DECISION)

**Problem Identified:**
- `ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` exists (464 lines) but is 32 hours out of sync with desktop
- Missing: Step 3 (Your Finances), Dr Elena calculations, Chatwoot handoff, session persistence
- User confirmed: "we are not completed on the desktop version" either

**Decision Made:**
- ‚úÖ **Use single responsive form:** `ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx`
- ‚ùå **Abandon separate mobile form:** Archive `ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx`
- üéØ **Rationale:** Don't split effort maintaining two incomplete implementations

**Implementation Approach:**
- Progressive enhancement with responsive CSS
- Mobile optimizations: 48px touch targets, single-column layout, sticky footer CTAs
- Use `@media (pointer: coarse)` for touch-specific styles
- Maintain single codebase for all business logic

**Exception - Chat Components:**
- ‚úÖ **Keep separate mobile chat:** `MobileAIAssistant.tsx` (different UX paradigm)
- Chat is full-screen immersive experience vs sidebar on desktop
- User confirmed: "for the AI chat interface, there's a mobile version right? yes"

### 8. AI Broker Conversation Strategy

**Approach:** Human-first, consultative (NOT scorecard/urgency tactics)

**Principles:**
- Natural conversation flow (like texting a knowledgeable friend)
- No visible scoring or "readiness indicators"
- Build trust through education, not pressure
- Suggest human broker when it makes sense contextually
- All ratings/handoff logic happens behind scenes

**Jay Abraham's Strategy of Preeminence:**
- Position as trusted advisor, not salesperson
- Educate first, sell second
- Make user feel understood and valued
- Create desire for more expert help (human broker)

**Conversation Tactics:**
- Ask clarifying questions (not interrogation)
- Explain complex concepts simply
- Share relevant insights based on user's situation
- Validate user's concerns and goals
- Offer actionable next steps

**Handoff Triggers (Behind Scenes):**
- User asks about specific banks/products
- User expresses urgency or specific timeline
- Complex scenario (e.g., self-employed, multiple properties)
- User explicitly asks to speak with human
- Rating score reaches threshold

## Codebase Audit Findings

### Current State

**System Status:** Production-ready with sophisticated AI orchestration

**Active Systems:**
- ‚úÖ BullMQ migration (Phase 3 - running in parallel with n8n)
- üü° n8n still active (being phased out)
- ‚úÖ Chatwoot fully integrated
- ‚úÖ Supabase as primary database
- ‚úÖ AI Orchestrator with multi-model support

**Git Branch:** `fix/progressive-form-calculation-corrections`

**Modified Files (Staged):**
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `README.md`
- Multiple form components
- Calculation files
- Test files
- Documentation files

### Tier 1 Files - Production vs Legacy

**Forms (PRODUCTION):**
- ‚úÖ `components/forms/ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx` (THE production form - will enhance for mobile)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `components/forms/ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` (EXISTS but 32 hours OUT OF SYNC - not using)

**Forms (LEGACY - TO DELETE):**
- ‚ùå `components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx` (old version without controller)
- ‚ùå `components/forms/IntelligentMortgageForm.tsx` (old wrapper)
- ‚ùå `components/forms/ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` (to archive - incomplete parallel implementation)

**Calculations (PRODUCTION):**
- ‚úÖ `dr-elena-mortgage-expert-v2.json` (THE source of truth - extracts Singapore regulations)
- ‚úÖ `lib/calculations/instant-profile.ts` (uses v2 JSON, production)
- ‚úÖ `lib/calculations/dr-elena-constants.ts` (extracts constants from v2 JSON)

**Calculations (NOT USED IN MAIN FORM):**
- üü° `lib/calculations/dr-elena-mortgage.ts` (standalone, hardcoded version - separate use case)
- ‚ùå `dr-elena-mortgage-expert.json` (v1 - old)

**Design (PRODUCTION):**
- ‚úÖ `/app/redesign/sophisticated-flow/page.tsx` (THE homepage)

**Design (ABANDONED - TO DELETE):**
- ‚ùå All other files in `/app/redesign/*` (experiments)

**AI Chat Components (PRODUCTION):**
- ‚úÖ `components/ai-broker/MobileAIAssistant.tsx` (mobile chat interface - KEEP separate)
- ‚úÖ `components/ai-broker/MobileAIAssistantCompact.tsx` (compact variant)
- ‚úÖ `components/ai-broker/MobileAIAssistantFixed.tsx` (fixed position variant)
- Note: Chat UX paradigm differs from form - separate mobile/desktop components justified

### Cleanup Tasks Identified

1. **Delete Abandoned Design Files:**
   - All `/app/redesign/*` except `sophisticated-flow/page.tsx`

2. **Remove Legacy Form Files:**
   - `components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx`
   - `components/forms/IntelligentMortgageForm.tsx`

3. **Delete Backup/Patch Files:**
   - `*.backup`, `*.fixed`, `*.patch` files throughout codebase
   - Example: `instant-profile.ts.patch`, `page.tsx.backup`

4. **Archive Old Experiments:**
   - `.NextNest_Mortgage_Calculator/` ‚Üí move to archive or delete

5. **Enhance Desktop Form for Mobile (REVISED STRATEGY):**
   - DO NOT use separate `ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` (32 hours out of sync)
   - Instead: Add responsive CSS to `ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx`
   - Mobile enhancements: 48px touch targets, single-column layout, sticky CTAs
   - Archive `ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` to prevent confusion

6. **Consolidate Documentation:**
   - Move all session reports to `docs/reports/session-context/`
   - Archive completed plans from `docs/plans/active/`
   - Delete duplicate/obsolete reports in root directory

## Key Quotes from Brent

**Session 1:**

**On AI Broker Strategy:**
> "I want it to be subtle and human-like convo... become like Jay Abraham's strategy of preeminence"

**On Content Strategy:**
> "All A-D honestly" (wants comprehensive content strategy eventually)

**On Codebase Confusion:**
> "I'm genuinely confused" (about which files are production vs legacy)

**Asking for Strategic Advice:**
> "Can you step out of yourself and based on my goals, advise me"
(Asked multiple times throughout session - appreciated Claude stepping into advisory role)

**On Documentation Overload:**
> "Every question I ask spawns 3-5 new docs that themselves spawn more docs"
(Led to establishing 3-tier system with strict limits)

**Session 2 (Mobile Form Decision):**

**Challenging Assumptions:**
> "This is pretty different. can you get an agent to use playwright and access localhost:3000 and check?"
> "Or are you creating something based off what you think works?"

**Asking Core Question:**
> "My question is should the mobile version be different from our desktop version?"
> "Can you get the right advice on this?"

**Clarifying Desktop Status:**
> "Is it sync to what we develop on the progressiveformwithcontroller front? (Anyway we are not completed on the desktop version)"

**Final Decision:**
> "Yes, we will stick with your advice." (single responsive form approach)

**Clarifying Chat Components:**
> "but for the AI chat interface, there's a mobile version right?"
> "And yes for now, we will need to dig into it deeper later on."

## Context for Next Session

**Where We Left Off:**
- ‚úÖ Finished Section 1 (3-tier documentation + Phase 1 scope) - APPROVED
- üîÑ Revised Section 2 based on single responsive form strategy
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting for approval of Section 2 before proceeding to Section 3

**What's Clear:**
- Product vision and business model (mortgage advisory, NOT lead-gen)
- Phase 1 scope: 10 pages, smart form, AI broker, NO content generation
- Documentation system: 3-tier hierarchy (Code ‚Üí Runbooks ‚Üí Plans)
- Which files are canonical (Tier 1) and which to archive
- **Form strategy:** Single responsive `ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx`
- **Chat strategy:** Separate mobile component `MobileAIAssistant.tsx`

**Critical Decision This Session:**
- Abandoned separate mobile form approach (32 hours out of sync)
- Will enhance desktop form for mobile instead (progressive enhancement)
- Exception: Chat keeps separate mobile UI (different UX paradigm)

**What's Next:**
- Get approval on revised Section 2 (Mobile Form Experience)
- Continue to Section 3 (Form-to-Chat Transition)
- Sections 4-6, then final implementation plan

**Important Context:**
- Brent challenges assumptions - wants evidence-based recommendations
- Values strategic advice ("step out of yourself and based on my goals, advise me")
- Prefers incremental approvals (section by section)
- Wants clear rationale for technical decisions
- Appreciates agent-based investigation of actual code vs theoretical designs

- ‚úÖ Deleted 40 root-level docs (bug fixes, test reports, completion reports)
- ‚úÖ Archived 6 historical files to proper locations
- ‚úÖ Merged TECH_STACK_GUIDE.md (root + runbook, preserved architecture decisions)
- ‚úÖ Deleted BRAND_MESSAGING_GUIDE.md (superseded by runbook version)
- ‚úÖ Deleted RAILWAY_ENV_SETUP.md (secrets verified in .env files, never committed to git)
- ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to prevent future `*_SETUP.md` secret exposure

**Git Commits:**
- `d95a6c6` - security: add setup files with secrets to .gitignore
- `98fb081` - docs: comprehensive root-level documentation cleanup

### Code Cleanup - 4,065 Lines Removed

- ‚úÖ Deleted `lib/insights/mortgage-insights-generator.ts` (zero production usage)
- ‚úÖ Deleted `lib/domains/forms/services/MortgageCalculationService.ts` (zero imports)
- ‚úÖ Archived `ProgressiveFormMobile.tsx` with abandonment header (32 hours out of sync)
- ‚úÖ Archived `IntelligentMortgageForm.tsx` with abandonment header (zero production imports)
- ‚úÖ Archived `ProgressiveForm.tsx` with abandonment header (gate-based architecture)

**Archived Location:** `components/forms/archive/2025-10/`

**Git Commits:**
- `72dc02d` - refactor: remove dr-elena v1 and unused importers
- `677616a` - refactor: archive legacy form implementations
- `8acfd4c` - fix: update validation-dashboard to remove archived imports

### Verification Results
- ‚úÖ Build successful (npm run build passed)
- ‚úÖ All production files intact
- ‚úÖ No broken imports
- ‚úÖ Root directory: 63 files ‚Üí 15 files (76% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Codebase: 4,065 lines of legacy code removed/archived

---

## STILL PENDING

### Core Design Tasks (Priority)
1. **Create CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md** - Tier 1 files whitelist with allowed/forbidden changes
2. **Create docs/plans/ROADMAP.md** - Phase 1/2/3 strategic timeline
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add 3-tier documentation system rules
4. **Check form plans/runbooks** - Verify IPA field integration strategy before adding to roadmap

### IPA Status Field (Enhancement Identified)
- **Status:** Type exists in `lib/contracts/form-contracts.ts` but NOT in UI
- **Impact:** HIGH - Improves purchase timeline urgency detection
- **Decision:** Add to Phase 1 roadmap with code references
- **Action:** Check existing form plans/runbooks first to determine integration approach

### Design Specification (Paused)
- Section 1: System Architecture ‚úÖ APPROVED
- Section 2: Mobile Form Experience ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED (needs revision after cleanup)
- Sections 3-6: Not started
- Final Implementation Plan: Not started

---

## KEY LEARNINGS (Session 3)

### Cleanup Process
- **Always verify before deleting:** Agent verification caught RAILWAY_ENV_SETUP.md containing production secrets
- **Git history matters:** Checked if secrets were committed (they weren't - safe)
- **Abandonment headers are critical:** Added detailed "why archived" documentation to each legacy file
- **Merge before delete:** TECH_STACK_GUIDE preserved valuable architecture decisions from root version

### Agent Usage
- **Conservative context:** Used agents for all cleanup to preserve main session context for design work
- **Verification agents:** Ran multiple verification passes before any deletion
- **Extraction agents:** Safely extracted secrets and patterns before deletion

### Documentation Strategy Validated
- **3-tier system works:** Clear separation between Code (Tier 1), Runbooks (Tier 2), Plans (Tier 3)
- **Whitelist approach necessary:** CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md will prevent accidental canonical file changes
- **Cleanup creates clarity:** 76% reduction in root clutter makes navigation easier

---

## NEXT SESSION - START HERE

### Immediate Context
- **Branch:** `fix/progressive-form-calculation-corrections`
- **Cleanup:** COMPLETE - codebase is clean
- **Design:** PAUSED at Section 2 (needs revision)
- **Core Files:** Ready to create (CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md, ROADMAP.md)

### What to Do Next (In Order)

**Option A: Complete Core Design Files First**
1. Create CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md (30 min)
2. Create docs/plans/ROADMAP.md (45 min)
3. Update CLAUDE.md with 3-tier system (15 min)
4. Then return to design specification

**Option B: Continue Design Specification**
1. Check form plans/runbooks for IPA integration
2. Revise Section 2 (Mobile Form) based on cleanup findings
3. Continue Sections 3-6
4. Create implementation plan
5. Then create CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md and ROADMAP.md

**Recommendation:** Option A - Create the system infrastructure (CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md, ROADMAP.md) before continuing design work. This ensures future work follows the 3-tier system properly.
