# UX Implementation Session - September 4, 2025

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 4, 2025
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Objective**: Implement first phase of UX improvements from RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md
**Status**: ‚úÖ Day 1 Tasks Complete, Day 2 Tasks Partially Complete

---

## üéØ Session Objectives
Implement the simplified UX flow outlined in `remap-ux/RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md`:
- Reduce Step 2 to exactly 4 fields for both loan paths
- Remove micro-progressive disclosure states
- Improve mobile UX with visual cards and number inputs
- Fix state management issues

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Foundation Tasks (Day 1) - ALL COMPLETE
1. **Removed micro-progressive disclosure (2.1, 2.2, 2.3 states)**
   - Simplified `shouldShowField` function to show all Step 2 fields at once
   - File: `components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx` (Line 137)
   - All Step 2 fields now visible immediately when Step 2 is active

2. **Removed redundant fieldValues state**
   - Deleted `fieldValues` state declaration (Line 135)
   - Removed all `setFieldValues` calls throughout the form
   - Now uses React Hook Form's `watch()` as single source of truth

3. **Updated validation schemas**
   - File: `lib/validation/mortgage-schemas.ts`
   - Step 2 New Purchase: Only 4 fields (propertyCategory, propertyType, priceRange, combinedAge)
   - Step 2 Refinancing: Only 4 fields (propertyType, currentRate, outstandingLoan, currentBank)
   - Fixed syntax errors with proper indentation

### Core Field Implementation (Day 2 Partial)
1. **Converted property category to visual cards**
   - Replaced dropdown with single-column visual cards
   - Added icons and descriptions for each property type
   - Visual feedback with checkmark for selected option

2. **Kept only 4 core fields in Step 2 New Purchase**
   - Property Category (visual cards)
   - Property Type (conditional dropdown)
   - Property Price (S$ formatted input)
   - Approximate Age (number input with +/- buttons)

3. **Replaced age slider with number input**
   - Mobile-friendly with +/- buttons
   - Direct number entry supported
   - Range limited to 21-65 years
   - Added disclaimer about approximate calculation

4. **Removed purchase timeline field**
   - Completely removed from form and validation schema

5. **Added visible assumptions box**
   - Changed from hidden collapsible to READ-ONLY box
   - Shows after age and price are filled
   - Displays standard calculation assumptions
   - Clear disclaimer about broker customization

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Primary Files:
1. **`components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx`**
   - Lines modified: 137, 135, 609-649, 666-692, 714-755, 757-825, 794 (removed)
   - Changes: Removed progressive states, simplified field visibility, added visual cards

2. **`lib/validation/mortgage-schemas.ts`**
   - Lines modified: 238-259, 264-273, 278-328
   - Changes: Reduced to 4-field validation, fixed syntax errors

### Documentation Created:
1. **`remap-ux/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`**
   - Complete log of all changes made
   - Includes line numbers and specific modifications

2. **`remap-ux/RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md`** (Updated)
   - Marked completed tasks with checkboxes
   - Updated Critical Path section

---

## üêõ Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue 1: Validation Schema Syntax Error
- **Problem**: Return statements appearing outside function scope
- **Cause**: Incorrect indentation (8 spaces instead of 4) for if statements
- **Solution**: Fixed indentation using sed command and manual edits
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### Issue 2: State Management Redundancy
- **Problem**: Duplicate state tracking with fieldValues and React Hook Form
- **Solution**: Removed fieldValues state entirely, use watch() only
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

---

## üöÄ Current Application State

### Development Servers Running:
- **Port 3000**: Main development server (Active) ‚úÖ
- **Port 3001**: Previous instance (May be stale)
- **Port 3002**: Previous instance (May be stale)

### Form Structure - New Purchase:
```
Step 0: Loan Type Selection ‚úÖ (No changes needed)
Step 1: Who You Are ‚úÖ (3 fields - name, email, phone)
Step 2: What You Need ‚úÖ (4 fields only)
  - Property Category (visual cards)
  - Property Type (conditional dropdown)
  - Property Price (S$ formatted)
  - Approximate Age (number input +/-)
Step 3: Your Finances (Not yet modified)
```

### Form Structure - Refinancing:
```
Step 2: (Needs simplification - TODO)
  - Should have only 4 fields
  - Remove rate type complexity
  - Remove tenure extension
```

---

## üìä Metrics & Improvements

### Before Implementation:
- Fields in Step 2: 7-10 fields with micro-progressive states
- Field appearance: Progressive (one at a time)
- Mobile UX: Sliders difficult to use
- State management: Redundant tracking

### After Implementation:
- Fields in Step 2: Exactly 4 fields ‚úÖ
- Field appearance: All at once ‚úÖ
- Mobile UX: Touch-friendly buttons and cards ‚úÖ
- State management: Single source of truth ‚úÖ

---

## üîÑ Next Steps (TODO)

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Complete Refinancing Path Simplification**
   - Reduce to 4 fields only
   - Remove rate type selector
   - Add "Prefer not to say" option for current bank

2. **Implement Step 3 Changes**
   - New Purchase: Add actual ages/incomes collection
   - Refinancing: Simplify to income/job changes assessment
   - Implement IWAA calculation

3. **Fix Instant Calculations**
   - Trigger once after all 4 fields complete
   - Use generic rates (2.6-3.2%)
   - Add hasCalculated flag

### Testing Required:
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (375px width)
- [ ] Complete flow testing (both paths)
- [ ] Instant calculation triggers
- [ ] Form submission

---

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Less is more - showing all fields at once reduces cognitive load
2. **Mobile UX**: Number inputs with +/- buttons far superior to sliders
3. **State Management**: React Hook Form's watch() eliminates need for custom state
4. **Visual Design**: Card-based selection improves engagement vs dropdowns

---

## üìù Important Notes

### Design Decisions Made:
- Property category uses single column layout for mobile
- Age input uses combined Age instead of approximateAge (field name)
- Assumptions box always visible (not collapsible)
- Removed all fields not in 4-field requirement

### Pending Decisions:
- Step 3 field structure for refinancing
- IWAA calculation implementation details
- Instant calculation rate sources
