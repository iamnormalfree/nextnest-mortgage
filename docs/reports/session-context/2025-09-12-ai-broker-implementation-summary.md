# AI Broker Implementation Summary - Session Context

## Date: September 11, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Complete n8n Workflow PostgreSQL to HTTP Migration
Successfully converted all PostgreSQL nodes to HTTP requests to resolve credential refresh issues:

#### Converted Nodes:
- âœ… **Check Broker Assignment** (Execute a SQL query2) â†’ HTTP/RPC `check_broker_assignment`
- âœ… **Assign Best Broker** (Assign Best Broker 2) â†’ HTTP/RPC `get_assigned_broker`  
- âœ… **Create Assignment Records** â†’ HTTP REST API POST
- âœ… **Get Broker Details** (Execute a SQL query3) â†’ HTTP REST API GET
- âœ… **Update Metrics** â†’ HTTP/RPC `update_metrics_after_response`
- âœ… **OpenAI Message a model** â†’ HTTP REST API to OpenAI Chat Completions

#### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Fixed assign_best_broker function** - Was returning NULL, updated to always return a broker
2. **Fixed broker_id assignment** - Was passing 'null' string instead of UUID
3. **Removed non-existent columns** - Removed `role` column that doesn't exist in schema
4. **Updated Merge Broker Context** - Fixed to handle both array and object inputs from HTTP nodes
5. **Added test conversation handling** - Gracefully handles test IDs that don't exist in Chatwoot

### 2. Supabase Functions Created

```sql
-- Functions created for n8n integration:
1. check_broker_assignment(conversation_id_param INTEGER)
2. get_assigned_broker(p_lead_score, p_loan_type, p_property_type, p_monthly_income, p_timeline)  
3. update_metrics_after_response(p_conversation_id, p_broker_id, p_message_count, p_handoff_triggered, p_handoff_reason)
4. assign_best_broker (updated to always return a broker)
```

### 3. Workflow Testing Results

#### TRUE Path (New Broker Assignment):
- Conversation ID: 91460
- Assigned: Michelle Chen (aggressive personality)
- Lead Score: 82
- AI Response: Successfully generated with personality traits
- Metrics: Updated successfully

#### FALSE Path (Existing Broker):
- Conversation ID: 456  
- Existing: Michelle Chen
- Retrieved broker details successfully
- Continued conversation with context

#### Handoff Testing:
- Tested 5 scenarios that trigger handoff
- All correctly identified handoff conditions
- Test mode returns simulated actions (since test conversations don't exist in Chatwoot)

### 4. Configuration Setup

#### n8n Configuration:
- Created "Set Supabase Config" node with credentials
- All HTTP nodes reference this single configuration node
- No need for enterprise variables feature

#### Supabase Project:
- Project Reference: `xlncuntbqajqfkegmuvo`
- URL: `https://xlncuntbqajqfkegmuvo.supabase.co`
- Using session pooler for database connections
- REST API for all HTTP requests

### 5. Test Scripts Created

```bash
# Test new broker assignment
node scripts/test-n8n-new-broker.js

# Test existing broker  
node scripts/test-n8n-new-broker.js --existing

# Test handoff scenarios
node scripts/test-n8n-handoff.js
```

## Current Workflow State

### âœ… Working Components:
1. Broker assignment based on lead score
2. AI response generation with broker personality
3. Handoff detection and triggering
4. Metrics tracking and updates
5. Both TRUE and FALSE paths tested successfully

### ðŸ”§ Known Issues (Resolved):
1. ~~OpenAI node may have credential refresh issues~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Converted to HTTP request
2. Test conversations return 404 when trying to update Chatwoot (expected behavior)
3. ~~Some nodes still reference PostgreSQL credentials~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - All converted to HTTP

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks:
1. Create Broker Profile UI Components
2. Create lib/db/supabase-client.ts for NextNest
3. Update Chatwoot Conversation API to fetch broker from Supabase

## Key Documents Updated

1. `n8n-workflows/fix-broker-assignment-query.md` - Correct SQL queries without non-existent columns
2. `n8n-workflows/n8n-fixes-http-nodes.md` - Complete HTTP conversion guide
3. `n8n-workflows/fix-assign-broker-null.md` - Solutions for NULL broker assignment
4. `Docs/AI_BROKER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Complete implementation roadmap

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Use HTTP/REST over PostgreSQL connections** - More reliable, no credential refresh issues
2. **Use RPC functions for complex operations** - Cleaner than multiple REST calls
3. **Handle test conversations gracefully** - Return success for test IDs instead of errors
4. **Single configuration node** - All HTTP nodes reference one "Set Supabase Config" node

## Next Session Focus

1. Address OpenAI node credential refresh issue
2. Build frontend components for broker display
3. Integrate Supabase client in NextNest
4. Test with real Chatwoot conversations

## Success Metrics Achieved

- âœ… 100% of PostgreSQL nodes converted to HTTP
- âœ… All workflow paths tested and working
- âœ… AI responses generated with correct broker personality
- âœ… Handoff logic working correctly
- âœ… Database metrics updating successfully
