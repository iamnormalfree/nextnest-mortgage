# Session Context Summary - Chatwoot Integration Implementation
**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Session Focus:** Form-to-Chat AI Broker Integration using Chatwoot

## 🎯 Session Objectives
Implement the Form-to-Chat transition system as outlined in `AI_Broker\FORM_TO_CHAT_IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_LIST.md`, replacing Tiledesk with Chatwoot for lead handoff from ProgressiveForm Step 3 to AI-powered chat broker.

## 🏗️ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Tiledesk Removal & Cleanup ✅
**Problem:** Legacy Tiledesk integration code was still present throughout the codebase
**Actions Taken:**
- Removed all Tiledesk API routes (`tiledesk-conversation`, `tiledesk-webhook`, `test-tiledesk`)
- Deleted Tiledesk integration files from `lib/integrations/`
- Removed Tiledesk components (`TiledeskPreloader.tsx`)
- Cleaned up Tiledesk test scripts from `scripts/`
- Updated all comments and references to use Chatwoot instead
- Fixed TypeScript errors after removal

**Files Affected:**
- ❌ Deleted: `app/api/tiledesk-*` routes
- ❌ Deleted: `lib/integrations/tiledesk*.ts`
- ❌ Deleted: `components/forms/TiledeskPreloader.tsx`
- ✏️ Modified: `components/forms/IntelligentMortgageForm.tsx`
- ✏️ Modified: `app/api/broker-response/route.ts`
- ✏️ Modified: `app/api/detect-conversion/route.ts`
- ✏️ Modified: `app/api/market-data/route.ts`

### 2. Chatwoot API Integration Implementation ✅

#### Sub-Task 1.1: API Route Structure ✅
**File:** `app/api/chatwoot-conversation/route.ts`
- Created comprehensive Zod validation schema matching ProgressiveForm Step 3 data structure
- Defined `ChatwootConversationResponse` interface with widget configuration
- Implemented POST handler with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Added support for all form fields including refinance and commercial specific data

**Key Features:**
- Validates all Step 3 form fields (name, email, phone, ages, incomes, employment)
- Handles optional co-applicant data for joint applications
- Supports refinance-specific fields (lock-in status, refinancing goals)
- Includes fallback response when Chatwoot is unavailable

#### Sub-Task 1.2: Broker Persona Mapping ✅
**File:** `lib/calculations/broker-persona.ts`
- Created `BrokerPersona` interface with comprehensive persona attributes
- Implemented `calculateBrokerPersona()` function with three persona types:
  - **Aggressive (75-100 score):** Marcus Chen - Premium rates focus, high urgency
  - **Balanced (45-74 score):** Sarah Wong - Educational consultative approach
  - **Conservative (0-44 score):** David Lim - Value focused, supportive approach
- Added helper functions:
  - `getBrokerAvailability()` - Returns availability message based on urgency
  - `generatePersonaGreeting()` - Creates persona-specific greetings
  - `analyzeMessageUrgency()` - Determines response urgency from message content
  - `getConversationStarters()` - Provides persona-appropriate conversation starters

#### Sub-Task 1.3: Chatwoot Client Implementation ✅
**File:** `lib/integrations/chatwoot-client.ts`
- Created `ChatwootClient` class with full API integration
- Implemented contact creation/update with deduplication
- Added conversation creation with comprehensive custom attributes
- Included automatic initial message generation based on persona
- Environment variable validation with clear error messages

**Key Methods:**
- `createOrUpdateContact()` - Handles contact management with search first approach
- `createConversationWithContext()` - Creates conversation with full lead context
- `createConversation()` - Main orchestration method
- `sendInitialMessage()` - Sends personalized AI broker greeting
- `getWidgetConfig()` - Returns frontend widget configuration

**Data Flow:**
1. Receive form data from ProgressiveForm Step 3
2. Calculate broker persona based on lead score
3. Create/update contact in Chatwoot
4. Create conversation with all context attributes
5. Send initial personalized message
6. Return widget configuration for frontend

### 3. Data Structure Verification ✅
**Analysis Completed:**
- Verified ProgressiveForm Step 3 sends exact data structure expected by API
- Confirmed lead score is calculated and passed (lines 242-292 in ProgressiveForm)
- Validated all form fields match between frontend and backend
- Ensured proper handling of optional fields and co-applicant data

**Key Fields Validated:**
- Basic: name, email, phone
- Loan: loanType, propertyCategory, propertyType, propertyPrice
- Income: actualAges[], actualIncomes[], employmentType
- Optional: existingCommitments, creditCardCount, applicantType
- Refinance: lockInStatus, refinancingGoals, propertyValue

## 📊 Implementation Progress

### Backend API Development: 75% Complete (3/4)
- ✅ Sub-Task 1.1: API Route Structure (100%)
- ✅ Sub-Task 1.2: Broker Persona Mapping (100%)
- ✅ Sub-Task 1.3: Chatwoot API Integration (100%)
- ⏳ Sub-Task 1.4: Circuit Breaker & Fallback Logic (0%)

### Other Tasks: Pending
- Frontend Components: 0% (0/3)
- AI Enhancement: 0% (0/2)
- Security Implementation: 0% (0/2)
- Analytics Setup: 0% (0/2)
- Infrastructure Setup: 0% (0/2)

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Persona Names Updated:**
   - Kept Marcus Chen for aggressive
   - Changed to Sarah Wong for balanced (was David Tan)
   - Changed to David Lim for conservative (was Sarah Lim)

2. **API Design:**
   - Used Zod for robust input validation
   - Implemented nested try-catch for Chatwoot-specific vs general errors
   - Added 503 status for service unavailable (Chatwoot down)
   - Included detailed fallback responses with phone/email/WhatsApp options

3. **Data Security:**
   - All sensitive data passed through validated schemas
   - Phone numbers validated for Singapore format
   - Email validation with normalization
   - Custom attributes properly typed and structured

4. **Integration Pattern:**
   - Client class pattern for Chatwoot API
   - Environment variable validation on initialization
   - Async/await with proper error handling
   - Fallback mechanisms at multiple levels

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **TypeScript Errors:**
   - Fixed `brokerPersona` type indexing issue
   - Resolved `leadScore` possibly null errors
   - Corrected `errors` object symbol indexing

2. **Build Issues:**
   - Removed all Tiledesk import errors
   - Fixed module resolution issues
   - Ensured clean build with no errors

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Sub-Task 1.4):
1. Implement Circuit Breaker pattern
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Create comprehensive fallback system

### Frontend (Task 2):
1. Create ChatTransitionScreen component
2. Implement ChatWidgetLoader
3. Integrate with ProgressiveForm

### Testing Requirements:
1. Test with actual Chatwoot instance
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test fallback scenarios
4. Validate persona assignment logic

## 🔑 Environment Variables Required
```bash
CHATWOOT_BASE_URL=https://chat.nextnest.sg
CHATWOOT_API_TOKEN=api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
CHATWOOT_ACCOUNT_ID=1
CHATWOOT_INBOX_ID=1
