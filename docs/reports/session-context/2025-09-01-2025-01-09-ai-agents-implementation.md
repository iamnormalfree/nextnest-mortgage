## üîç Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Patterns
1. **Class-based agents** with clear separation of concerns
2. **Zod validation** for input sanitization
3. **TypeScript interfaces** for strong typing
4. **Async/await pattern** for future API integration

### Data Flow Design
```typescript
Input ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Enhancement ‚Üí Result
```

### Simulation vs Production Ready
- Current: Simulated market data using time-based cycling
- Future-ready: Dependency injection points for MarketDataService
- Graceful fallback when real data unavailable

## üìä Integration Points

### With Existing System
- Uses same validation patterns as `lib/validation/mortgage-schemas.ts`
- Compatible with form data from `components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx`
- Ready to replace n8n webhook calls in `app/api/forms/analyze/route.ts`

### Future Data Sources (Documented in MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- MAS API for SORA rates
- Fed data feeds for policy analysis
- Economic indicators (CPI, unemployment)
- NLP analysis of central bank communications

### Task 4.3: DynamicDefenseAgent
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**File**: `lib/agents/dynamic-defense-agent.ts`

#### Implemented Features:
1. **Client Profile Analysis**
   - Risk profile assessment
   - Financial capability evaluation
   - Goals and priorities identification

2. **Multi-Layer Defense Strategy**
   - Primary approach generation
   - Alternative options creation
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Broker value proposition

### Task 4.4: CompetitiveProtectionAgent  
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**File**: `lib/agents/competitive-protection-agent.ts`

#### Implemented Features:
1. **Competitor Detection**
   - Email domain checking (DBS, OCBC, UOB, etc.)
   - Rapid completion detection (<30s threshold)
   - Pattern analysis for automated behavior
   - Session monitoring and flagging

2. **Information Gating**
   - Sensitive data filtering
   - Generic response generation
   - Strategic intelligence protection
   - Rate information obscuring

### Task 5: n8n Dependency Removal
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/api/forms/analyze/route.ts`

#### Implementation Details:
1. **n8n Code Commented** - Preserved for potential future use
2. **Local AI Orchestration** - `runLocalAIAnalysis()` function created
3. **Gate-Specific Processing**:
   - Gate 2: Basic analysis with 2 agents
   - Gate 3: Full analysis with all 4 agents
4. **Lead Scoring** - Based on AI analysis results
5. **Fallback System** - Psychological responses if AI fails

## üîÑ HOW THE AI AGENTS WORK IN THE LEAD FORM

### Integration Architecture
```
User Form Input ‚Üí API Route ‚Üí AI Orchestration ‚Üí Protected Response
                      ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
              [analyze/route.ts] [4 AI Agents]  [CompetitiveProtection]
```

### Gate 2 Flow (Basic Analysis)
1. User completes: Name, Email, Phone, Property Details
2. API receives submission with `submissionPoint: 'gate2'`
3. AI Orchestration runs:
   - SituationalAnalysisAgent.analyze()
   - RateIntelligenceAgent.generateIntelligence()
4. CompetitiveProtectionAgent checks for competitors
5. Information filtered if competitor detected
6. Returns preliminary insights

### Gate 3 Flow (Complete Analysis)
1. User adds: Monthly Income, Commitments, Preferences
2. API receives submission with `submissionPoint: 'gate3'`
3. Enhanced AI Orchestration:
   - Basic situational analysis
   - Financial enhancement applied
   - Defense strategy generated
   - Full rate intelligence
4. Lead score calculated (>70 triggers broker notification)
5. Comprehensive insights returned

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Task 6)
- [ ] Create SimpleAgentUI component
- [ ] Display agent insights effectively
- [ ] Add broker consultation CTA

### Schema Updates (Task 2)
- [ ] Update loan types (remove equity_loan)
- [ ] Add property categories
- [ ] Create Gate 3 validation schema

### Testing & Validation (Task 9)
- [ ] Full integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## üí° Important Notes

### Testing Approach
Both agents were tested with comprehensive test scripts:
- Multiple loan scenarios (new_purchase, refinance)
- Various property types (HDB, Private, EC)
- Different risk profiles and preferences
- Financial enhancement capabilities

### Future Enhancement Path
The agents are designed with clear extension points:
1. `getCurrentMarketPhase()` ‚Üí Real SORA data
2. `getCurrentFedStance()` ‚Üí Fed policy API
3. `MarketDataService` injection ‚Üí Database integration
4. Fallback mechanisms ‚Üí Graceful degradation

### Code Quality
- Clean, well-documented code
- Comprehensive type safety
- Modular, testable functions
- Clear separation of concerns
