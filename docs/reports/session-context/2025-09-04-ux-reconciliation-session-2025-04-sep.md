# 📋 UX RECONCILIATION SESSION CONTEXT
**Date: 04 Sept, 2025**
**Focus: Form Flow Simplification & Mortgage Accuracy**

---

## 🎯 SESSION OVERVIEW

### **What We Did**:
1. Analyzed current implementation vs original UX Improvement Plan
2. Identified major divergences from core principles
3. Integrated stakeholder feedback on mortgage calculations and UX flow
4. Created reconciliation plan with specific field mappings
5. Conducted critical review with Tech Team UX expert and Dr. Elena

### **Key Documents Created**:
- `RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan to fix implementation issues
- `RECONCILIATION_REVIEW.md` - Critical analysis of violations and recommendations

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### **Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Task 1.1-1.4: Gate structure simplified to Steps
- ⚠️ Task 2.1-2.3: Instant calculations partially working but too complex
- ❌ Task 2.2: LLM market insights not implemented
- ❌ Progressive disclosure overly complex with micro-states

### **Major Issues Found**:
1. **Complexity Creep**: Step 2 has 8-10 fields instead of 3-4
2. **IWAA Age Wrong**: Using average age instead of income-weighted
3. **State Management Chaos**: Redundant tracking, micro-progressive states
4. **Mobile UX Poor**: Sliders, grids, excessive scrolling
5. **Validation Misalignment**: Schemas don't match actual fields

---

## 🔄 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### **REFINANCING SIMPLIFICATION**:
- **REMOVE**: Rate type selector, floating spread fields → Move to broker
- **REMOVE**: Age slider if no tenure extension needed
- **KEEP**: Core 4 fields only (property type, current rate, outstanding loan, current bank)
- **DEFER**: Complex tenure calculations to broker

### **NEW PURCHASE APPROACH**:
- **ISSUE**: Need age for instant calc but average age is inaccurate
- **DECISION**: Show disclaimer about approximate calculation
- **COLLECT**: Actual ages + incomes in Step 3 for accurate IWAA
- **REMOVE**: Purchase timeline from Step 2 → Move to broker

### **MOBILE OPTIMIZATIONS**:
- **CHANGE**: Property cards from 2x2 grid → Single column
- **CHANGE**: Age slider → Number input with +/- buttons
- **PRINCIPLE**: Max 3 conditional branches per step

### **DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY**:
- **Credit Cards**: Use count × $50/month assumption (not credit limit)
- **Employment**: Keep simple (employed/self-employed/recently changed)
- **Current Bank**: Required field but allow "Prefer not to say"
- **Income Changes**: Keep vague, let broker probe details

---

## 📈 INSTANT INSIGHTS APPROACH

### **New Purchase**:
1. Show max loan based on **approximate** age (with disclaimer)
2. Use placeholder rates until LLM_BANK_INSIGHTS_ARCHITECTURE ready
3. Display assumptions clearly (not hidden)
4. One-time calculation to avoid confusion

### **Refinancing**:
1. Show potential savings using generic market range
2. Once LLM database ready, show "lowest rate available" to entice
3. Exclude current bank from recommendations
4. Keep calculations simple and conservative

---

## 🎨 UX PRINCIPLES REINFORCED

### **Core Principles to Maintain**:
1. **Less is More**: Hard limit of 3-4 visible fields per phase
2. **Show Value Fast**: Value after 3 fields maximum
3. **Broker Handoff**: Defer all complex scenarios
4. **Mobile-First**: Vertical layouts, touch-friendly
5. **Trust Building**: Clear disclaimers, not hidden assumptions

### **Conditional Logic Rules**:
- Maximum 3 conditional branches per step
- Show related fields together (not micro-progressive)
- Clear indication of optional vs required
- No "required but optional" contradictions

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **State Management**:
```typescript
// SIMPLIFIED APPROACH
const fieldGroups = {
  new_purchase: {
    step2: ['propertyCategory', 'propertyType', 'propertyPrice', 'approximateAge'],
    step3: ['actualAges', 'actualIncomes', 'commitments', 'employment']
  },
  refinance: {
    step2: ['propertyType', 'currentRate', 'outstandingLoan', 'currentBank'],
    step3: ['incomeChanges', 'employment', 'packagePreference']
  }
}
```

### **Validation Schema Updates Needed**:
- Remove complex conditional validation
- Add new fields: actualAges[], actualIncomes[]
- Simplify refinancing fields
- Align with simplified flow

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### **Immediate Actions**:
1. Simplify Step 2 to 3-4 core fields only
2. Remove micro-progressive disclosure
3. Implement proper IWAA calculation in Step 3
4. Create mobile-first layouts

### **Phase 2 Actions**:
1. Integrate LLM_BANK_INSIGHTS_ARCHITECTURE for real rates
2. Build disclaimer system for assumptions
3. Optimize instant calculation triggers
4. Clean up state management

### **Testing Required**:
1. Mobile usability on small screens
2. Form completion rates with simplified flow
3. Accuracy of IWAA calculations
4. User understanding of disclaimers

---

## 📝 KEY STAKEHOLDER NOTES

### **Mortgage Accuracy (Per Discussion)**:
- Average age acceptable for Step 2 WITH clear disclaimer
- Actual IWAA calculation in Step 3 with both ages/incomes
- Credit card assumption: Count × $50/month for TDSR
- Tenure calculations too complex → Broker handles

### **UX Simplification (Agreed)**:
- Remove all rate type complexity from form
- Purchase timeline not needed in Step 2
- Employment status kept simple (3 options max)
- Package preferences as single-select buttons

### **Data Quality Balance**:
- Better to collect approximate data quickly than perfect data never
- Clear handoff points to broker for refinement
- Disclaimers about calculation assumptions
- Progressive value delivery even with approximations

---

## 🔍 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **What NOT to Do**:
1. Don't add more fields to Step 2
2. Don't use complex conditional logic (>3 branches)
3. Don't hide critical assumptions
4. Don't ask for same data twice without reason
5. Don't implement features that break mobile UX

### **What TO Do**:
1. Show value after minimal input
2. Use clear disclaimers for approximations
3. Defer complexity to broker
4. Optimize for mobile first
5. Keep state management simple

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### **Target Performance**:
- Step 2 completion: <45 seconds
- Fields per step: 3-4 maximum
- Mobile completion rate: >50%
- Form abandonment: <20% per step
- Instant value delivery: After 3 fields

### **Quality Indicators**:
- Clear user understanding of assumptions
- Smooth broker handoff
- Accurate IWAA calculations (Step 3)
- Minimal validation errors
- No state management bugs

---

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

The session revealed significant drift from core principles. Main issues:
1. Over-complexity in field collection
2. Incorrect mortgage calculations (IWAA)
3. Poor mobile optimization
4. State management complications

The reconciliation plan needs aggressive simplification to achieve original goals. Focus on collecting minimal accurate data quickly rather than comprehensive data that causes abandonment.

**Key Principle**: Progressive disclosure should be at step level, not field level.
