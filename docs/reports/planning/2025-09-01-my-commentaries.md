Let me just say at that gate 2, don't really care about csash equity as it is a small part, but with the loan specific fields that we capture in gate 2 we should need to generate AI nsights that are more than urgency. Like for new purchase, if they are urgent and have already placed OTP, they only have 21 days to exercise the option (check with  @dr-elena-mortgage-expert.json on timeline to confirm this across private and resale HDB, for new private launches, new EC launches or BTO... the concern is not with OTP but with other like: for EC,there's delayed payment scheme and progressive payment scheme. The timeline and payments will affect them so they need to plan the finance properly and normally, the developers will need them to secure a loan (which then requires an IPA + loan application) when they place a deposit of interest, failing which they can't buy and might forfeit their deposit or pay a fee. THen if you do delayed payment scheme, basically once you TOP and take keys then the bulk of your loan will kick in and then you have to make payment. WHile launches normally take 3-4 years, you only need to sell your house (most people are upgraders and only has one house due to not wanting to pay ABSD or they have not considered decoupling yet, so the house is under 2 person's name, husband and wife. So delayed payment scheme will make sense, although it wil incure an additional 2-3%. For people with enough CPF or cash on hand, they might want to save on the additional interest and do a progressive scheme whereby they will pay per construction stages. So basically, buying new launches, as
it is far out into the future, most banks will give floating packages instead of fixed. they will give flexbilitiy to convert to fixed basically earliest is 3 months before TOP, which clients won't know when can take keys, as developers might delay. For resale HDB and resale private, it is more direct as it will be about OTP and their eligibility plus whether they are buying single name or not, and if they are selling their house to buy a new one and we have to make sure timeline is okay and that they have enough in CPF ans cash to buy that house while selling their old house. 
   
   
For refinancing, knowing their current bank is the utmost importance as we don't earn from repricing and many times, if the loan is high enough, and bank RMs are hungry enough, they will either have automated emails sent to them about the lowest repricing rates available. Unlike refinancing which requires 2 months notice of redemption and need you to pay legal fee and valuation fee (if above certain loan qunatum, most if not all will be waived off but comes with 3 years clawback except for 1-2 banks with 2 years), then the process of cancelling with the bank (percevied as by right the incoming bank will inform for you), the going through hassle of paperwork signing with another bank, another letter of offer to sign officially, might need to open their banks or any criterias like opening accounts, getting credit cards or fulfilling premier accoutn requirements as well as a visit to law firm to sign and then serving the notice and then finally, the loan being moved over. It is a back of the mind thing that runs off for 2-2.5 months. Vs, if repricing team timed correctly, they will send over the notice at around 1 month before your end of lockedin period is up. Repricing takes around 2 weeks to a month to take effect, moving you to selected packages which they offer that you can choose at their bank. Not much paperwork and if you have a free conversion, normally repricing fee of $500-800 is waived off. If not, if your loan quantum is adequate, they will waive it off for you. So some times, those nearing end of locked in period (and within 2 months), it is a double edged sword to prioritise them or not, as we are not sure if repricing has spoken with them and we cannot directly ask them as it might trigger them to reach out to repricing team. Sometimes, even if they need to check something in regards to their current loan package and if they dont have their current letter of offer or they forgot their exact end of lockedin period, we will not tell them to find out from their current bank, and insteadd will manage our way out and then if and only if our current bankers that is from their current bank is willing to help check then will we ask them to check for us. For those who is way away from their end of lockedin period is not so urgent yet as the ooptimal time to reach out and start building rapport with clients is around 4-5 months before end of locked in, to slowly nurture the psychology of them to start thinking about refinancing. Of course there will still be opportunities for the repricing team to reach out earlier or for the client to get both refinancing rates and then trigger their repricing enquiry to compare or pit against each other to get better deals. So we have to factor that in. Then there is the last group which is out of lockedin period. So for some reasons their existing banks did not reached out to them. MIght be due to the RM not having commissions as they are not new purchases and so it is all handled by repricing team whom someone missed them. IN which we will take the opportunity to take advantage of that by saying that the banks will of course be willing for you to pay higher interests and not inform you, so they do not have your best interest at heart. So the next problem is that the benefit of refinancing must outweigh the benefit of staying in the current package, which if the loan qunatum is low enough, and for HDB loan quantum below 250k and private loan quantum below 450k, there is no legal or valuation fee subsidies or cash rebate being given, which greatly increases the cost of refinancing. If the loan quantum is low enough, they might find the lesser refinancing rates will come up to not much for the next 2-3 years fixed or floating packages that they are switching to as compared to the cost of refinancing. Still at this point, you still can't discount the fact that after overpaying for many months after end of lockedin period at a higher rate, if their loan is substantial and after speaking to you about refinancing, they got triggered and got the motivation to go reach out to their current bank and after all the analysis, decided on repricing... absolutely possible. Not forgetting that as clients don't pay a fee, they are free to pitch brokers against brokers. So all brokers will do their best to avoid current bank and to select bank packages that can be pit against repricing team. repricing team will come up with 2-3 packages and it is best to pitch a different story so as to increase your odds of winning. Also if a broker already submitted forms for a client, their names for that banks might be tagged under that broker, so even if nothing is confirmed yet but initial bank forms are submitted, it might be locked by the other broker and you have to then craft a story for a particular package against repricing team and that broker. Basicaly besides knowing rates, we have to know the bank features and what each banks' proclivities are as well as a defense against repricing team and a defense against other brokers, trying our best to fish out info about our competitors and then use bank packages features, any categorical distinction e.g. years of fixed rate packages, 1M SORA vs 3 M SORA, legal fee or cash subsidies amount, timeilne, fire insurance, paperwork required, speed of application, any further strategiv moves like moving house soon and require waiver of penalty due to sale, any need to take cash equity loan for investment or urgent use or any need to do prepayment to have peace of mind and want to do it without penalties. Then having a nimble brain, we must craft our attack and recommend the packages that can align a flexibility approach to having a peace of mind while having access to the most upside and cap down inside e.g. in a good market, in a recession, if US feds cut rates how it affects us, how US politics or donald trumph or world wars affects us and the SORA rates. 


│ > can you bring @dr-elena-mortgage-expert.json to clarify any mortgage understanding but i feel that with the gate 2 loan speicifc fields, besides urgency not being specific enough and not   │
│   having enough psychological triggers to cajole them to the next round of anlaysis and get them to contact us as brokers. I think financial details as gate 3 is not even a good description  │
│   as for refinancing, normally they are already eligbile for the loan and if they are not retrenched or have sudden lost of incoome (if their income goes up, they will need their max loan    │
│   eligibliity calcualted but that is for because they want to afford a more expensive house and not because they can't get a loan). So financial details is more for calculations of IPA and   │
│   to see how much they are eligiblie for a new house loan. can you read @Remap\my-commentaries.md and then relooked at what we have built for the intelligent form and AI insights for gate 2  │
│   and gate 3? How do we built the data structure, schemas, types, fields, field values and how it flows between the 4 gates and if any AI agent should step in between to value add... such    │
│   that they can be so primed and ready to speak to our brokers

│ > 2 more comments: we try not to mention repriicng for fear of triggering them to reach out to them. you can see this as a psychological non priming also. We also want to gate our AI agents  │
│   to not be answering competitor brokers or real estate agents trying to use our expertise to answer questions to their clients. We want all of them to route to our brokers in the final      │
│   step. And for investmnet criteria, hardly there will be people trying to do portfolio expansion, unless our goal is to recommend them to commerical properties. And even so, to not affect   │
│   their TDSR, we will recommend them to open an investment holding company to buy commerical properties to not trigger TDSR. most people are buying house to use as primary residenes,         │
│   upgrading or decoupling so each person can buy 1 property (each as in a married couple). So buying as a single purchase or married or buying with family members or friends matters. Also    │
│   some times they are buying using single name might not be single as they are already set up for deoupling, their spouse owns a property already and they might not have mentioned. So        │
│   obviously we want to withhold rates till chatting with our brokers directly and as banks don't allow us to share deviated rates openly ( by saying xyz rates is from DBS... we using ajust   │
│   us D$$$$S to protect us on rates pdf that we sent out) and will compare only 3-5, if not too many choices client will be confused, and something that will pitch your best odds package as   │
│   being seen as the best option.    



one more refinement, of course all users want to find some meaningful information about rates. What are we able to show them based on their gate 2 inputs, and with that put them into a     │
│   situation whereby we show them levers of things affect rates and show some sort of information about rates that is not too generic but tailored to them? I don't know how to do this yet     │
│   but things which affect rates are US fed meetings, which is affected by inflation & unemployment & CPI in US... these are affects local SORA rates. and finally, bank change their packages  │
│   accordingly to each other, with local banks changing first, being mostly led by DBS. and normalyl foreign banks have more interest package features like citibank, Standard chartered and    │
│   HSBC has interest offset accounts and for maybank, CIMB and some other foreign banks, they are more flecible in seeing brokerage accounts funds, forex funds, foriegn currencies when it     │
│   comes to show of funds and pledge of funds to loan more or to increase their max loan eligbility. So how can we still prime them customised rates related information or about banks which   │
│   we ned to make an educated guess, other than their current banks and to pit against their current banks, what are the range of banks (still have to defend against property agents using     │
│   our platforms, other brokers using our platforms or simply other brokers who might have locked in the best bank package with the client and we need backups and insurance against) and what  │
│   are the main strategies of comparison against bank packages that might interrst them.
