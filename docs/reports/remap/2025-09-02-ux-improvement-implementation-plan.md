# 🎯 UX IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Based on Tech Team Roundtable Analysis**
**Date: February 9, 2025**

---

## 📊 IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

### **Guiding Principles**
1. **Modular Implementation** - Each task is atomic and testable
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Don't break what works
3. **User-First Design** - Based on "Who You Are", "What You Need", "Your Finances"
4. **Compliance First** - No bank-specific rates, careful disclaimers
5. **Mobile Priority** - Every change must work on mobile
