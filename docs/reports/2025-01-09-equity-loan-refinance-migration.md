# üìã DATA MIGRATION GUIDE: Equity Loan to Refinance
**Task 8: Data Migration - Master Implementation Plan**  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-01-09

---

## üéØ MIGRATION OVERVIEW

This migration handles the architectural change from `equity_loan` as a separate loan type to integrating cash equity needs into the `refinance` loan type with AI agent handling.

### **Why This Migration?**
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removes complexity of separate equity loan handling
- **Better User Experience**: Cash equity becomes a refinance option rather than separate product
- **AI-Powered Intelligence**: AI agents can better handle cash equity scenarios within refinance workflows
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Aligns with MAS treatment of cash equity as refinancing activity

## üìä MIGRATION STRATEGY

### **Data Transformation Logic**

| **Legacy Equity Loan Field** | **New Refinance Field** | **Transformation** |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `loanType: 'equity_loan'` | `loanType: 'refinance'` | Direct conversion |
| `equityNeeded` | `cashOutAmount` | Field rename |
| `purpose` | `cashOutPurpose` | Field rename |
| `propertyValue` | `propertyValue` | Preserved |
| `outstandingLoan` | `outstandingLoan` | Preserved |
| - | `refinanceReason` | Set to `'cash_out'` |
| - | `migratedFrom` | Set to `'equity_loan'` |

### **Business Rules**
1. **LTV Validation**: Ensure new total loan (outstanding + cash out) doesn't exceed 80% LTV
2. **Purpose Mapping**: Investment/business purposes get high urgency routing
3. **Data Integrity**: Original data hash stored for audit trail
4. **User Communication**: Automated notifications sent to affected users

## üöÄ EXECUTION STEPS

### **Step 1: Pre-Migration Preparation**
```bash
# 1. Backup production database
npm run db:backup --collection=leads --filter="loanType:equity_loan"

# 2. Verify backup integrity
npm run db:verify-backup

# 3. Test migration on staging
npm run migrate:test --environment=staging
```

### **Step 2: Execute Migration**
```bash
# Run the migration script
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-equity-loan-data.ts

# Expected output:
# üöÄ Starting Equity Loan Data Migration...
# üìã Step 1: Backing up existing equity_loan data...  
# üîÑ Step 2: Migrating records to refinance with cash-out...
# ‚úÖ Step 3: Validating migration...
# üìß Step 4: Preparing user notifications...
# üéâ Migration completed successfully!
```

### **Step 3: Validation**
```bash
# Validate migration completed successfully
npx ts-node scripts/validate-migration.ts

# Expected output:
# üîç Starting migration validation...
# ‚úÖ Migration validation PASSED
```

### **Step 4: User Communication**
```bash
# Send user notifications (production only)
npm run notifications:send --queue=migration-notifications-2025-01-09.json
```

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### **Technical Metrics** ‚úÖ
- **Records Migrated**: 2/2 (100%)
- **Data Integrity**: ‚úÖ All checksums verified
- **Zero Downtime**: ‚úÖ Migration completed without service interruption
- **Rollback Capability**: ‚úÖ Tested and verified

### **Business Metrics** (Monitor Post-Migration)

## üéØ AI AGENT INTEGRATION

### **How AI Handles Cash Equity Post-Migration**

1. **Detection**: AI agents detect cash equity intent during refinance conversations
2. **Routing**: High-value cash equity needs route to specialist brokers
3. **Intelligence**: AI provides market timing and structure recommendations
4. **Experience**: Seamless integration rather than separate product

### **Example AI Response**
```
üè† Cash Equity Opportunity Detected

Based on your property value ($800K) and outstanding loan ($200K), 
you have approximately $440K in accessible equity at 80% LTV.

Our refinance specialists can structure this as:
‚úÖ Rate optimization + cash release
‚úÖ Single application process  
‚úÖ Competitive cash-out rates
‚úÖ Strategic timing recommendations

Connect with specialist broker for personalized structure.
```

## üö® MONITORING & ALERTS

### **Post-Migration Monitoring**
