# Controller & Legacy Calculation Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**Audit Scope:** Analysis of duplicate calculation logic in controller and legacy files that could be consolidated with recalibrated instant-profile.ts calculators.

**Key Findings:**
- 8 duplicate or redundant functions identified across mortgage.ts and controller logic
- 4 HIGH PRIORITY consolidation opportunities - Direct duplicates of persona-aligned logic  
- 2 MEDIUM PRIORITY items - Legacy functions still in use but should migrate to persona constants
- 2 LOW PRIORITY items - Utility functions that are appropriately placed
- 1 CRITICAL ISSUE - Hard-coded credit card commitment formula contradicts persona logic

**Overall Severity:** MEDIUM - No blocking issues, but significant consolidation opportunities exist to reduce maintenance burden and ensure persona alignment.
