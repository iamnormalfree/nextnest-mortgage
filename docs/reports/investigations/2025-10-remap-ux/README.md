## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### **To implement a task:**

```bash
# 1. Open the implementation process
code remap-ux/IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS_UX.md

# 2. Find your task in the plan
code remap-ux/UX_IMPROVEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

# 3. Check what files to change
code remap-ux/implementation-file-changes-ux.md

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev

# 5. Begin with first subtask
# Follow the process exactly as documented
```

### **Example: Starting Task 1**

```bash
# Task 1: Simplify Gate Structure

# 1. Read Task 1 specification
# Location: UX_IMPROVEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md → Task 1

# 2. Check file changes needed
# Location: implementation-file-changes-ux.md → Phase 1 → ProgressiveForm.tsx

# 3. Execute Subtask 1.1
# - Open components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx
# - Change line 114: currentGate from 1 to 0
# - Test progress indicator
# - Commit: "feat(ux-task-1.1): update gate numbering"

# 4. Continue with remaining subtasks...
```

3. **Measure Metrics** - Stop if they degrade
4. **Follow the Process** - No shortcuts
5. **Document Everything** - Track all changes

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Must Achieve:**
- Completion rate: >60% (from <40%)
- Time to value: <30s (from 2-3 min)
- Mobile completion: >50% (from <20%)
- Field abandonment: <10% (from high)

### **Must Not Break:**
- Form submission
- Data validation
- API contracts

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If metrics drop:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Check rollback procedure in IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS_UX.md
3. Revert changes
4. Document in issues/
5. Adjust approach

### **If TypeScript fails:**
1. Check types/mortgage.ts
2. Verify schemas in lib/validation/
3. Run `npm run type-check`

### **If mobile breaks:**
1. Test in Chrome DevTools
2. Check touch target sizes (44px min)
3. Verify responsive breakpoints
