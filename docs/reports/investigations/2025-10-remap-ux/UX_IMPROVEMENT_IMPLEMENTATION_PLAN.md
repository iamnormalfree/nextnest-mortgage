## üîß PHASE 1: FOUNDATION FIXES (Week 1)
**Goal: Fix critical UX issues without major restructuring**

### **Task 1: Simplify Gate Structure**
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Dependencies: None**
**Impact: High - Affects entire form flow**

#### Subtasks:
```typescript
1.1. Update gate numbering system
    - Change internal numbering from 0-3 to cleaner progression
    - Keep loan type selection separate (before form)
    - Files: components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx
    - Test: Verify progress indicator shows correctly

1.2. Reorganize form fields into 3 clear steps (DETAILED FIELD MAPPING)
    
    STEP 1: "Who You Are" - Contact Information Group
    - Keep existing: name (string, min 2, max 100)
    - Keep existing: email (string, email validation)
    - MOVE HERE: phone (from current Gate 2 to Step 1)
    - Field order: name ‚Üí email ‚Üí phone
    - Validation: All 3 fields required before proceeding to Step 2
    
    STEP 2: "What You Need" - Property/Loan Details (CONDITIONAL BY LOAN TYPE)
    
    For NEW PURCHASE (Keep current flow, optimize UX):
    VISIBLE TOGETHER (Visual Cards):
    - propertyCategory (EXISTING): Visual cards instead of dropdown
      * üè† Resale HDB/Condo | üèóÔ∏è New Launch | üéØ BTO | üè¢ Commercial
    - propertyType (EXISTING): Smart conditional options based on category
      * If resale: All types available (HDB/EC/Private/Landed)
      * If new_launch: Only EC/Private 
      * If BTO: Auto-set to HDB (hide field)
      * If commercial: Route to quick form
    
    PROGRESSIVE FIELDS:
    - propertyPrice (RENAME from priceRange): Format with commas, S$ prefix
    - combinedAge: slider 25-65, default 35 (NEW FIELD for instant calc)
    - Hidden Assumptions Box (NEW): LTV toggle, stress test rate, commitments
    
    AFTER INSTANT CALCULATION:
    - purchaseTimeline (EXISTING): Show after seeing loan estimate
    - Category-specific fields (UPDATE NEEDED):
      * If resale: otpStatus (keep existing)
      * If new_launch: 
        - launchStatus (keep existing)
        - projectName (keep existing)
        - topDate (UPDATE): Quarter selector (Q1-Q4) + Year selector (2024-2030)
      * If BTO: 
        - btoStage (keep existing)
        - completionDate (UPDATE): Quarter selector (Q1-Q4) + Year selector (2025-2032)
        - Display as: "Q3 2027" instead of specific date
    
    For REFINANCING (Optimized for instant insights):
    INSTANT INSIGHT FIELDS (Show first, progressive):
    - currentRate: number with % formatting OR "Floating rate" option
      * If floating: Show additional field for spread (e.g., SORA + X%)
      * If suspiciously low (<2.5%): Conditional prompt "What's your thereafter rate?"
      * Instant insight: "üìà Market rates: 2.6-3.2% vs your {currentRate}%"
    - outstandingLoan: number field with S$ formatting
      * Instant insight: "üí∞ Potential monthly savings: S${X}"
      * Calculate based on rate differential
    - currentBank: dropdown (DBS/OCBC/UOB/Standard Chartered/etc)
      * For exclusion from comparison (don't show same bank rates)
      * Optional field with "Prefer not to say" option
    
    TIMING ASSESSMENT (After instant insights):
    - lockInStatus: Radio buttons with smart descriptions
      * "No lock-in" ‚Üí "‚úÖ Free to refinance anytime"
      * "Ending soon (within 2-4 months)" ‚Üí "‚è∞ Perfect timing - start process now"
      * "Still locked in (>4 months)" ‚Üí "üìÖ Plan ahead - we'll notify you"
      * "Unsure" ‚Üí "ü§î Broker will check for you"
    
    ADDITIONAL FIELDS (Progressive after timing):
    - propertyType: 'HDB' | 'EC' | 'Private' | 'Landed'
    - propertyValue: number field (for cash-out calculation)
      * Show cash-out potential: "üíµ Max cash-out: S${amount}"
    - remainingTenure: number field (years)
    - combinedAge: slider 25-65, default 35 (for tenure extension calc)
    
    STEP 3: "Your Finances" - Income & Preferences
    - monthlyIncome: number field (keep existing)
    - existingCommitments: number field, optional, default 0 (keep existing)
    - packagePreference: 'lowest_rate' | 'flexibility' | 'stability' (keep existing)
    - riskTolerance: 'conservative' | 'moderate' | 'aggressive' (keep existing)
    - planningHorizon: 'short_term' | 'medium_term' | 'long_term' (keep existing)
    
    FIELDS TO REMOVE FROM FORM:
    - ownershipStructure (now AI-inferred from data patterns)
    - decouplingIntent (now AI-detected from profile)
    - firstTimeBuyer (move to optional or AI-inferred)

    KEY CHANGES NEEDED:
    - ADD combinedAge slider for instant loan/refinance calculations (NEW)
    - MOVE phone from Gate 2 to Step 1
    - NEW PURCHASE updates:
      * RENAME priceRange to propertyPrice with S$ formatting

      * ADD currentBank dropdown (for exclusion from comparison)
      * ADD lockInStatus radio buttons (no lock-in/ending soon/locked/unsure)
      * HANDLE floating rates: Additional spread field if floating selected
      * ADD conditional "thereafter rate" prompt if current rate suspiciously low
      * MOVE lockInStatus AFTER instant insights (for timing advice)
      * ADD smart rate comparison against internal database
    - KEEP other existing category-specific fields (already working)

      * Gate 1 ‚Üí Step 1: "Who You Are" (was "Basic Information")
        - Description: "Let's get to know you" (was "Get your personalized rate")
        - CTA: "Continue to property details" (was "See Detailed Analysis")
      * Gate 2 ‚Üí Step 2: "What You Need" (was "Contact Details")  
        - Description: "Tell us about your property goals" (was "Unlock full mortgage intelligence")
        - CTA: "Get instant loan estimate" (was "Get Full Report")
      * Gate 3 ‚Üí Step 3: "Your Finances" (was "Financial Profile")
        - Description: "Optimize your mortgage strategy" (was "Get broker-exclusive rates")
        - CTA: "Get personalized recommendations" (was "Get Best Rates & Expert Advice")
    - Update progress indicator to show "Step 1 of 3" format instead of Gate numbers
    - Files: components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx (formGates array)

```

### **Task 2: Implement Progressive Value Delivery**
**Priority: HIGH**
**Dependencies: Task 1 (field reorganization)**
**Impact: High - User engagement**

**New Step 2 Design Overview:**
- **3 Visible Fields**: Property Price, Property Type, Combined Age (slider with default 35)
- **Hidden Assumptions Box**: Collapsible with LTV toggle (75%/55%), stress test rate 4%, zero commitments
- **Smart Calculations**: Max loan eligibility based on property-specific tenure caps and age limits
- **Progressive Revelation**: 75% LTV default, 55% LTV for extended tenure option
- **User Education**: Age slider tooltip explains joint application averaging

#### Subtasks:
```typescript
2.1. Create instant calculation triggers (New Purchase & Refinancing)
    NEW PURCHASE: After Step 1 completion + 3 Step 2 fields
    - Trigger: property price + property type + age slider
    - Result: Max loan eligibility with 75% LTV default
    - Display: "üí∞ Max Loan: S$750,000" + "‚è±Ô∏è Monthly: S$3,756 @ 4% stress test"
    
    REFINANCING: After Step 1 completion + 3 Step 2 fields  
    - Trigger: currentRate (with thereafter rate if needed) + outstandingLoan + currentBank
    - Result: Accurate savings calculation excluding current bank
    - Display: "üí∞ Save S$450/month with market best rates"
    - After lockInStatus: Add timing advice "‚è∞ Perfect timing" or "üìÖ Plan ahead"
    
    SHARED FEATURES:
    - Hidden assumptions box: LTV toggle (75%/55%), stress test 4%, zero commitments
    - Age slider with default 35, tooltip for joint applications (average age)

2.2. Add LLM-powered market pulse insights (New Purchase & Refinancing)
    ARCHITECTURE: Daily LLM analysis of live bank database (see LLM_BANK_INSIGHTS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
    - Setup: Airtable/Excel 365 with 16 banks' packages (rates, features, constraints)
    - Cron: 9:05 AM daily (after SORA update) - LLM generates aggregated insights
    - Cache: Redis/PostgreSQL stores insights for 24 hours
    
    NEW PURCHASE insights (triggered by property type):
    - Fetch from: GET /api/insights/market/:propertyType
    - Display: "üè† HDB: Average 2.65-2.95%, fixed rates dominating"
    - Include: Rate ranges, trends, popular features (no bank names)
    
    REFINANCING insights (triggered by current rate):
    - Fetch from: GET /api/insights/refinance
    - Display: "üí∞ 14 packages beat your current 3.8% rate"
    - Include: Savings potential, package count, market timing

2.3. Implement progressive insight display
    - Step 1 completion: Show welcome message with trust signals ("üîí Bank-grade security", "üìß Never sold or shared")
    - Step 2 completion (property fields): Display max loan eligibility analysis with LTV comparison
      * New Purchase: "üí∞ Max Loan: S$750,000 (75% LTV)" vs "‚è±Ô∏è Extended tenure: 55% LTV available"
      * New Purchase property-specific: BTO="üèóÔ∏è Est. completion: 42 months", Resale="üìã OTP processing: 8 weeks", New Launch="üéØ Launch timeline: Q3 2025"
      * Refinancing: "üí∞ Cash-out potential: S$120,000" vs "üí∏ Monthly savings: S$450 with current rates"
      * Refinancing specific: Lock-in status="‚è∞ Lock-in expires: Dec 2025", Rate gap="üìà Your rate vs market: +0.8%"
    - Step 3 completion: PLACEHOLDER - Depends on finalizing Step 3 field structure and UX design
