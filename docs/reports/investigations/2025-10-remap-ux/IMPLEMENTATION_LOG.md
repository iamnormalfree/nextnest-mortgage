# Implementation Log
Date: September 4, 2025

## Day 1 Tasks Completed:
- [x] Removed micro-progressive states (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
  - Simplified `shouldShowField` function to show all Step 2 fields at once
  - All Step 2 fields now visible immediately when Step 2 is active
  
- [x] Removed redundant fieldValues state
  - Deleted `fieldValues` state declaration
  - Removed all `setFieldValues` calls throughout the form
  - Form now uses React Hook Form's `watch()` as single source of truth
  
- [x] Updated validation schemas
  - Step 2 New Purchase: Only 4 fields (propertyCategory, propertyType, priceRange, combinedAge)
  - Step 2 Refinancing: Only 4 fields (propertyType, currentRate, outstandingLoan, currentBank)
  - Removed unused fields: purchaseTimeline, ipaStatus, lockInStatus, propertyValue

## Changes Made:

### File: components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx
1. **Line 137**: Simplified `shouldShowField` function - now returns true for all Step 2 fields
2. **Line 135**: Removed `fieldValues` state declaration
3. **Lines 628, 669, 724, 764, 798, 911, 961, 1010, 1104, 1279, 1324**: Removed all `setFieldValues` calls
4. Progressive disclosure completely removed - all fields show at once per step

### File: lib/validation/mortgage-schemas.ts
1. **Lines 238-259**: Updated new_purchase Step 2 to only have 4 core fields
2. **Lines 264-273**: Updated refinance Step 2 to only have 4 core fields
3. Removed validation for fields: purchaseTimeline, ipaStatus, lockInStatus, propertyValue

## Testing Results:
- Form compiles without errors
- All 4 fields appear immediately in Step 2

## Day 2 - Refinancing Path Simplification Completed:

### Refinancing Step 2 - Reduced to 4 Fields:
- [x] **Task 1**: Removed combined age slider completely
  - Lines 1022-1067 removed
  - Age calculations deferred to Step 3
  
- [x] **Task 2**: Simplified current rate field
  - Removed rate type complexity
  - No floating spread or thereafter rate
  - Simple number input only
  
- [x] **Task 3**: Added "Prefer not to say" option for current bank

- [x] **Task 4**: Fixed instant calculation triggers
  - Lines 232-260: Updated to not require combinedAge
  - Now triggers with: propertyType, currentRate, outstandingLoan, currentBank
  - Uses generic tenure (30 years for Private/Landed, 25 for HDB/EC)
  
### Files Modified:
- **components/forms/ProgressiveForm.tsx**:
  - Lines 926-930: Removed progressive field conditionals
  - Lines 970-972: Simplified outstanding loan field  
  - Lines 1018-1025: Updated current bank field
  - Lines 1042-1058: Added "Prefer not to say" option
  - Lines 232-260: Fixed instant calculation logic

- **lib/validation/mortgage-schemas.ts**:
  - Lines 263-271: Already correctly configured with 4 fields

## Summary:
Both New Purchase and Refinancing paths now have exactly 4 fields in Step 2 as specified in RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md. The refinancing path no longer asks for age or tenure extension in Step 2, deferring these to Step 3 or broker consultation.

## Day 3 - Instant Calculation Fix:

### Task Completed: Fix instant calc trigger
- [x] **Added `hasCalculated` state flag** (Line 133)
  - Prevents recalculation on every field change
  - Resets when changing steps
  
- [x] **Updated useEffect logic** (Lines 211-286)
  - Only triggers when `currentStep === 2 && !hasCalculated`
  - Checks ALL 4 required fields are complete before calculating
  - New Purchase: propertyCategory, propertyType, priceRange, combinedAge
  - Refinancing: propertyType, currentRate, outstandingLoan, currentBank
  - Sets `hasCalculated = true` after successful calculation
  - Resets flag when moving to different step
  
### Testing Verification:
- ✅ Calculation triggers ONLY once when all 4 fields complete
- ✅ No recalculation when modifying fields after initial calc
- ✅ Flag properly resets when navigating between steps

### Task Completed: Use placeholder rates for calculations
- [x] **Added `getPlaceholderRate()` function** (Lines 38-50 in mortgage.ts)
  - Returns 2.8% for HDB/EC properties
  - Returns 3.2% for Private/Landed properties  
  - Returns 3.5% for Commercial properties
  
- [x] **Updated `calculateInstantEligibility()`** (Line 69 in mortgage.ts)
  - Now uses `getPlaceholderRate(propertyType)` instead of hardcoded 2.8%
  - Rates adjust based on property type selected
  
- [x] **Added TODO comments** (Line 226 in ProgressiveForm.tsx)
  - Marked for Phase 2: LLM Bank Insights integration
  - Clear documentation of placeholder usage
  
- [x] **Refinancing calculations** (Line 134 in mortgage.ts)
  - Using 2.6% as generic lowest rate placeholder
  - Will be replaced with actual bank rates in Phase 2

### Implementation Details:
- Placeholder rates provide consistent baseline for instant calculations
- Avoid triggering multiple recalculations with dynamic rates
- Users see disclaimer "Based on market rates 2.6-3.2%"
- Actual rates will come from LLM Bank Insights in Phase 2

## Day 3 - Complex Field Removal:

### Tasks Completed: Remove unnecessary Step 2 fields
- [x] **Remove OTP status details** 
  - Already removed from form fields
  - Only references in comments remain
  
- [x] **Remove IPA status fields**
  - Removed from validation schema (line 84)
  - Form already cleaned
  
- [x] **Remove launch-specific dates**
  - Removed completion date field from BTO section
  - No launch date fields found
  
- [x] **Remove BTO stage details**
  - Removed entire BTO stage selector (lines 569-596)
  - Cleaned from validation schema
  
- [x] **Remove CPF usage details**
  - Removed from validation schema (line 86)
  - Field already removed from form
  
- [x] **Remove downpayment readiness**
  - Removed from validation schema (line 85)
  - Field already removed from form

### Summary:
All complex fields have been successfully removed from Step 2, simplifying the form to exactly 4 core fields as specified in the RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md.

## Day 3 - UI Improvements Completed:

### Tasks Completed: UI refinements from audit
- [x] **Fix tenure calculation in instant analysis**
  - Line 72 in mortgage.ts: Changed retirement age from 65 to 75
  - Fixed calculation: `const maxTenure = Math.min(35, (75 - combinedAge))`
  
- [x] **Make assumptions collapsible**
  - Added `showAssumptions` state (Line 133)
  - Changed from always-visible box to click-to-show dropdown
  - Added chevron icon that rotates when expanded
  - Smooth animation on expand/collapse
  
- [x] **Remove property type dropdown for commercial**
  - Line 637: Added condition `&& propertyCategory !== 'commercial'`
  - Line 218: Added logic to use 'Commercial' as effective property type
  - Line 223: Updated validation to not require propertyType for commercial
  
- [x] **Update age label to "Your Age/Average Age"**
  - Line 730-731: Changed label from "Approximate Age (for initial calculation)"
  - New label clearly indicates it works for both single and joint applications

### Implementation Summary:
All requested UI improvements have been implemented. The form now:
1. Uses correct 75-year retirement age for tenure calculations
2. Has a collapsible assumptions section that only shows on click
3. Skips property type field for commercial properties
4. Uses clearer age labeling for better UX

## Next Steps:
- Implement proper IWAA calculation in Step 3
- Test complete flows end-to-end
- Mobile optimization improvements
- Add visual enhancements
