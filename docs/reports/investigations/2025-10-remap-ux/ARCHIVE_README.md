## About This Archive

This directory contains UX and architecture planning documentation from earlier development phases of the NextNest mortgage application. These documents were created during the transition to the Shadcn UI component library and the redesign of the progressive form flow.

## Contents

- **Field Mapping:** UX improvements for form field handling
- **Implementation Guides:** Junior developer onboarding and implementation protocols
- **Shadcn UI Migration:** Testing checklists, component mappings, and implementation logs
- **Phase 3 Reports:** Testing reports and metrics from the Shadcn migration phase
- **Reconciliation Plans:** Architecture reconciliation and review documents

## Historical Context

These documents represent planning and implementation work from September 2025, when the application was undergoing significant UX improvements. They have been archived because:

1. The work described has been completed and merged
2. Active documentation now lives in `docs/runbooks/`
3. Current architecture is documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
