# Runbooks Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Auditor:** Claude (HEAVY tier orchestration)
**Scope:** All 71 runbook files in `docs/runbooks/`
**Context:** Post folder-reorganization cleanup - ensure runbooks follow 3-tier standards

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Runbooks:** 71 files
**Automated Checks Completed:**
- ✅ Broken folder references (sessions/, meta/, etc.): **0 files** (clean!)
- ⚠️ Redesign/ path references: **5 files** (needs update)
- ⚠️ Archive references: **2 files** (needs review)

**Status:**
- ✅ **Good**: TBD
- ⚠️ **Needs Update**: 5+ files (broken paths, minor fixes)
- 🔄 **Needs Rewrite**: TBD
- ❌ **Archive**: TBD

---

## Audit Framework

### Category Definitions

**✅ GOOD** - Ready for production use
- No broken references
- Links to Tier 1 code (not duplicating it)
- Aligned with current architecture
- Clear, actionable content
- Up-to-date with recent changes

**⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE** - Minor fixes required
- Broken path references (redesign/, moved folders)
- Outdated file paths
- Minor inaccuracies
- Missing cross-references
- Formatting issues

**🔄 NEEDS REWRITE** - Major issues
- Duplicates Tier 1 code (violates 3-tier rules)
- References deprecated architecture
- Incorrect implementation guidance
- Conflicts with CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md
- Poor organization or structure

**❌ ARCHIVE** - No longer relevant
- Superseded by newer runbooks
- References removed features
- Outdated technology/approach
- Better covered elsewhere

---

## Automated Findings

### 1. Broken Folder References

**Checked for:** `docs/sessions/`, `docs/evaluations/`, `docs/validation-reports/`, `docs/meta/`

**Result:** ✅ **0 files found** - All runbooks clean!

**Reason:** Our recent folder consolidation was comprehensive, and we already updated active plans that referenced these folders.

### 2. Redesign/ Path References

**Checked for:** `redesign/` (old path structure)

**Result:** ⚠️ **5 files found**

**Files:**
1. `docs/runbooks/FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
2. `docs/runbooks/Founder_Ops_Guide.md`
3. `docs/runbooks/mobile-form-optimization/reference/design-system-rules.md`
4. `docs/runbooks/mobile-form-optimization/01-ONBOARDING.md`
5. `docs/runbooks/mobile-form-optimization/ARCHIVE-original-plan.md`

**Action Required:** Update paths from `redesign/` to current production paths (`app/page.tsx`, etc.)

### 3. Archive References

**Checked for:** `app/archive/`, `components/archive/`, `lib/archive/`

**Result:** ⚠️ **2 files found**

**Files:**
1. `docs/runbooks/FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
2. `docs/runbooks/Founder_Ops_Guide.md`

**Action Required:** Review if archive references are intentional (documentation of legacy) or need updating to current files.

---

## Manual Review Required

### High Priority - Check for Tier 1 Violations

**Criteria:** Runbooks should LINK to Tier 1 code, never duplicate implementation

**Files to Check:**
- All runbooks with large code blocks (>20 lines)
- Runbooks referencing calculation logic
- Runbooks with component implementation examples

**Validation:** Compare against `CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md` - if code exists in Tier 1 file, runbook should link to it with `file:line` reference, not paste it.

### Medium Priority - Architecture Alignment

**Check for references to:**
- Deprecated forms (ProgressiveForm.tsx vs ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx)
- Old calculator implementations
- Superseded API routes
- Changed database schemas

**Validation:** Compare against `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md` for current architecture.

### Low Priority - Organization & Quality

**Check for:**
- Clear purpose statements
- Proper domain organization (chatops/, devops/, etc.)
- Cross-reference consistency
- Formatting and readability

---

## Domain Breakdown

**By folder:**
- `docs/runbooks/` (root): 15 files
- `automation/`: 14 files (+ phase-2-n8n-workflow subdirectory)
- `mobile-form-optimization/`: 19 files (tasks/, testing/, reference/ subdirectories)
- `chatops/`: 3 files
- `devops/`: 3 files
- `forms/`: 1 file
- `operations/`: 1 file
- `testing/`: 1 file
- `archive/`: 13 files

**Analysis:**
- Largest domains: mobile-form-optimization (19), automation (14)
- Smallest domains: forms (1), operations (1), testing (1)
- Archive folder exists (13 files) - need to verify these are truly obsolete

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)

1. **Review 5 files with redesign/ paths** - Update to current production paths
2. **Review 2 files with archive references** - Determine if intentional or needs update
3. **Scan FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md** - Most likely to have Tier 1 violations (referenced in both automated findings)
4. **Check archive/ folder** - 13 files - are they truly obsolete or just misplaced?

### Short Term (Next Session)

5. **Manual Tier 1 violation scan** - Check all runbooks for code duplication
6. **Architecture alignment check** - Verify against current ARCHITECTURE.md
7. **Cross-reference validation** - Ensure runbook links work

### Long Term (Ongoing)

8. **Create runbook quality checklist** - For future runbook creation
9. **Add runbook review to change process** - When Tier 1 files change, check dependent runbooks
10. **Consider runbook templates** - Standardize structure

---

## Detailed Findings

### Files Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
**Issues Found:**
- Contains `redesign/` path references
- Contains `archive/` references
- High risk for Tier 1 violations (forms are core Tier 1)

**Priority:** HIGH - This is a critical runbook for form implementation

**Action:** Full manual review needed

#### 2. Founder_Ops_Guide.md
**Issues Found:**
- Contains `redesign/` path references
- Contains `archive/` references

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Operational guide, less technical

**Action:** Path updates needed

#### 3-5. mobile-form-optimization/ files
**Issues Found:**
- Multiple files with `redesign/` references
- Includes ARCHIVE file (intentionally archived?)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Domain-specific documentation

**Action:** Review mobile optimization runbooks as group

## Questions for User

1. **Archive folder (13 files)** - Should we review these to confirm they're truly obsolete, or trust they were intentionally archived?

2. **Mobile optimization domain (19 files)** - This is the largest domain. Should we prioritize reviewing this entire domain for consistency?

3. **Immediate fix preference** - Should we:
   - Fix the 5 redesign/ path issues now?
   - Continue with full audit first, then batch fixes?
