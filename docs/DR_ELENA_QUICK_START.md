# Dr. Elena Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
```env
# Add to .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migration (if not already done)
psql $DATABASE_URL < lib/db/migrations/001_ai_conversations.sql
```

### 3. Test Installation
```bash
# Test pure calculations (no API keys needed)
npx tsx scripts/test-dr-elena-pure-calculations.ts

# Test full integration (requires API keys)
npx tsx scripts/test-dr-elena-integration.ts
```

## üìã How It Works

### User asks a calculation question
```
User: "How much can I borrow with my $6000 monthly income?"
```

### System Flow
1. **Intent Router** classifies message as "calculation_request"
2. **Dr. Elena** runs MAS-compliant calculations
3. **AI Explainer** generates natural language response
4. **Audit Trail** records calculation in Supabase
5. **Chatwoot** sends formatted response to user

### Response Format
```
Based on your S$6,000 monthly income:

üìä **Your Mortgage Snapshot:**
‚Ä¢ Max Loan: **S$341,000**
‚Ä¢ Monthly Payment: **S$1,426**
‚Ä¢ Down Payment: **S$159,000**
‚Ä¢ Cash Required: **S$25,000**
‚Ä¢ TDSR: 38.33% (limit: 55%)

üîë **Key Points:**
‚Ä¢ MSR (30% rule) is limiting your loan amount for HDB
‚Ä¢ You're well within TDSR limits (38% vs 55% max)
‚Ä¢ Strong financial position for first property purchase

üìå **Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Get pre-approval to lock in your borrowing capacity
2. Start viewing properties up to S$500,000
3. Prepare your documents for faster processing

What questions do you have about these calculations?

## üîß Common Tasks

### Check if Dr. Elena is Active
```typescript
// In any file
import { drElenaService } from '@/lib/ai/dr-elena-integration-service';

const response = await drElenaService.processCalculationRequest({
  conversationId: 123,
  leadData: {
    name: 'Test User',
    leadScore: 75,
    loanType: 'new_purchase',
    propertyCategory: 'HDB',
    propertyPrice: 500000,
    actualIncomes: [6000],
    existingCommitments: 500,
    age: 30,
    citizenship: 'Citizen',
    propertyCount: 1,
    employmentType: 'employed'
  },
  brokerPersona: calculateBrokerPersona(75, 'HDB', 'new_purchase'),
  userMessage: 'How much can I borrow?'
});

console.log(response.chatResponse);
```

### View Recent Calculations
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT
  conversation_id,
  calculation_type,
  (inputs->>'monthlyIncome')::numeric as income,
  (results->>'maxLoan')::numeric as max_loan,
  (results->>'tdsrUsed')::numeric as tdsr,
  mas_compliant,
  timestamp
FROM calculation_audit
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Compliance Rate
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_calcs,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE mas_compliant = true) as compliant,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE mas_compliant = true) / COUNT(*), 1) as compliance_rate
FROM calculation_audit
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Calculation not being triggered"
**Check:**
1. Intent router classification working?
   ```typescript
   const intent = await intentRouter.classifyIntent(message, context);
   console.log('Intent:', intent.category, intent.requiresCalculation);
   ```
2. Is user message too vague? Try: "How much can I borrow?"

### Issue: "Calculations seem wrong"
**Verify:**
1. Input data is correct:
   ```typescript
   console.log('Lead Data:', leadData);
   ```
2. Check MAS compliance flags:
   ```typescript
   console.log('MAS Compliant:', calculation.masCompliant);
   console.log('Warnings:', calculation.warnings);
   ```

### Issue: "Audit trail not saving"
**Debug:**
1. Check Supabase connection
2. Verify conversation exists in `conversations` table
3. Review foreign key constraints

### Issue: "Redis connection error"
**Fix:**
```bash
# Test Redis connection
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping
# Should return: PONG
```

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard Queries

### Daily Summary
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as calculations_today,
  COUNT(DISTINCT conversation_id) as unique_conversations,
  AVG((results->>'tdsrUsed')::numeric) as avg_tdsr,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE mas_compliant = false) as non_compliant
FROM calculation_audit
WHERE timestamp::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Top Property Types
```sql
SELECT
  inputs->>'propertyType' as property_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG((results->>'maxLoan')::numeric) as avg_loan
FROM calculation_audit
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY inputs->>'propertyType'
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Limiting Factors
```sql
SELECT
  results->>'limitingFactor' as factor,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage
FROM calculation_audit
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY results->>'limitingFactor'
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Always Validate Input
```typescript
if (!leadData.actualIncomes?.[0]) {
  console.warn('Missing income data, using default');
}
```

### 2. Check MAS Compliance
```typescript
if (!result.calculation.masCompliant) {
  console.log('Non-compliant:', result.calculation.warnings);
  // Consider flagging for human review
}
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
```typescript
const start = Date.now();
const result = await drElenaService.processCalculationRequest(request);
console.log(`Dr. Elena response time: ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
```

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully
```typescript
try {
  const result = await drElenaService.processCalculationRequest(request);
  return result.chatResponse;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Dr. Elena error:', error);
  return 'I apologize, I\'m having trouble with calculations right now. Let me connect you with a specialist.';
}
```

## üìà Success Metrics

### Target KPIs
- ‚úÖ Response time: <3 seconds
- ‚úÖ MAS compliance: >99%
- ‚úÖ User satisfaction: Measured via handoff rate
- ‚úÖ Cost per calculation: <$0.001

### How to Track
```sql
-- Average response quality (proxy: no immediate handoff)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_calculations,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM conversations c
    WHERE c.id::text = ca.conversation_id
    AND c.custom_attributes->>'handoff_triggered' = 'true'
    AND c.custom_attributes->>'handoff_time'::timestamp - ca.timestamp < INTERVAL '2 minutes'
  )) as successful_no_handoff,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM conversations c
    WHERE c.id::text = ca.conversation_id
    AND c.custom_attributes->>'handoff_triggered' = 'true'
  )) / COUNT(*), 1) as success_rate
FROM calculation_audit ca
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## üîê Security Notes

### Data Privacy
- Calculations stored with conversation_id only
- No PII in calculation_audit table
- Audit trail subject to GDPR/PDPA retention policies

### Access Control
- Use service role key for Supabase (not anon key)
- Redis credentials secured in environment
- OpenAI API key with rate limits
