ABOUTME: Consolidated Stage 0 launch gate checklist spanning rate, ops, UX, and compliance.
ABOUTME: Tracks prerequisites across re-strategy parts before opening the public funnel.

# Stage 0 Launch Gate Checklist

Stage 0 represents the professional readiness gate defined in Part 02. Every item below must be verified (and the linked CAN tasks marked “Completed”) before we open the funnel beyond internal testing.

## How to Use This Checklist
- Review during the weekly Growth/Ops backlog session noted in Part 02.
- Update task statuses in `docs/plans/re-strategy/backlog/master-task-list.csv`; this table mirrors that source rather than replacing it.
- Log launch-readiness evidence and decision dates in `docs/work-log.md`.
