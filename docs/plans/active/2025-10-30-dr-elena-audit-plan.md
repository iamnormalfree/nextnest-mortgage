# Dr Elena v2 Calculation & Rules Audit Plan

> Exhaustive guide for auditing `docs/plans/active/2025-10-30-progressive-form-experience-implementation-plan.md` to ensure every calculator and UX expectation aligns with `dr-elena-mortgage-expert-v2.json`.

## Orientation
- **Goal**: Confirm the implementation plan, calculator specs, and upcoming code changes faithfully reflect persona-backed mortgage logic (LTV, tenure, CPF usage, TDSR/MSR). When refinance data is absent in the persona, capture that gap explicitly rather than assuming rules exist.
- **Audience**: Skilled developer with zero NextNest or Singapore mortgage context, limited testing instincts.
- **Approach**: Work iteratively, documenting findings, writing failing tests before implementation tweaks, committing frequently.

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Node.js 18+ installed (`node -v`).
- ✅ Ability to run npm scripts (`npm -v`).
- ✅ Familiarity with Git basics (branching, commits, diffs).
- ✅ Access to the repo with current branch checked out.
- ✅ Read `README.md` for local setup instructions.

## Required Reading (Do Not Skip)
1. `docs/plans/active/2025-10-30-progressive-form-experience-spec.md` — UX specification that must be validated against persona logic.
2. `docs/plans/active/2025-10-30-progressive-form-experience-implementation-plan.md` — Workstream we are auditing.
3. `dr-elena-mortgage-expert-v2.json` — Persona source of truth for calculations.
4. `docs/reports/INSTANT_CALCULATION_STRATEGY_v2.md` — Prior instant analysis rationale.
5. `docs/plans/active/2025-10-14-progressive-form-restoration-plan.md` — Historical context for Step 2/3 expectations.
6. `docs/runbooks/PROGRESSIVE_FORM_COMPACT_EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK.md` — Process framing for progressive form tasks.

Take notes; you will reference them in documentation deliverables.

## Tooling Reference
- Run scripts with `npm run …` from repository root.
- Use `node -e "…"`, `node scripts/*.js`, or small TypeScript scripts to parse JSON (prefer Node over Python).
- Prefer `rg` for text search (`rg "instantCalc"`).
- Tests will run via `npm test -- --runInBand`.
- For markdown output checks, use `npm run lint` to ensure formatting stays clean (ESLint handles MDX/TS/TSX).

## Git Hygiene
- Create a dedicated branch before touching files:  
  `git checkout -b audit/dr-elena-v2-alignment`
- Commit after each numbered step (or major sub-step) using descriptive messages, e.g., `docs: add ltv audit matrix`.
- Never commit failing tests or lint errors.
- Avoid touching unrelated files; leave whitespace untouched unless modified by formatter.

## Deliverables
- Updated implementation plan annotations (if gaps found).
- New audit doc summarising persona-to-plan mapping: `docs/reports/DR_ELENA_V2_CALCULATION_MATRIX.md`.
- Calculator fixture outline under `tests/fixtures`.
- Journal update (`docs/work-log.md`) recording findings and TODOs.
- Issue list (if discrepancies) captured in the audit doc and highlighted to Brent before implementation begins.

## Step-by-Step Audit Tasks

### 1. Baseline Snapshot
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and `npm test -- --runInBand`; save outputs for reference (no changes expected yet).
- [ ] Open `/apply` (optional) to observe current behaviour; note discrepancies vs spec for context only.
- [ ] Record your initial observations in a separate scratchpad (outside repo).
- Commit: none yet.

### 2. Persona Deep-Dive
- [ ] Read `dr-elena-mortgage-expert-v2.json` completely. Focus on:
  - `computational_modules.rounding_rules`
  - `computational_modules.ltv_limits`
  - `computational_modules.core_formulas`
  - `computational_modules.income_recognition`
  - `computational_modules.commitment_calculations`
  - `computational_modules.cpf_usage_rules`
  - `computational_modules.specialized_calculators.bridging_financing`
  - `computational_modules.property_specific_rules`
  - `test_scenarios`
- [ ] Summarise key takeaways in a new markdown file `docs/reports/DR_ELENA_V2_CALCULATION_MATRIX.md`. Structure:
  - LTV & tenure triggers.
  - CPF/cash requirements.
  - TDSR/MSR formulas & floors.
  - Refinance data points present (or explicitly confirm absence).
  - Edge clauses (self-employed recognition, variable income, cash-out constraints).
- [ ] Use Node to assist extraction (e.g., `node - <<'JS' …`), paste sanitized tables into the doc.
- Commit: `docs: capture dr elena v2 calculation matrix`.

### 3. Map Persona Rules to Implementation Plan
- [ ] In `docs/plans/active/2025-10-30-progressive-form-experience-implementation-plan.md`, annotate (via inline comments or bullet references) where each persona rule is expected to be implemented.
  - Example: Link Step 2 LTV toggle tasks to the persona’s `ltv_limits.individual_borrowers`.
- [ ] Identify plan gaps or ambiguities (e.g., missing mention of MSR rounding, tenure caps). Record them in a dedicated “Open Questions” section within the plan.
- [ ] Update the plan status from `draft` to `in-progress` once annotations begin.
- Commit: `docs: align implementation plan with dr elena guidance`.

### 4. Define Calculator Test Fixtures
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/dr-elena-v2-scenarios.ts` exporting typed fixtures derived from persona `test_scenarios`.
- [ ] For each scenario, include:
  - Input description.
  - Expected max loan, tenure, monthly payment, CPF/cash.
  - Expected TDSR/MSR outcomes or notes.
  - Refinance-specific expectations that the persona actually provides (e.g., cash-out constraints, servicing rules). Note missing items like monthly savings for future requirements.
- [ ] Ensure fixtures reference line numbers or keys from the persona doc in comments for traceability.
- Commit: `test(fixtures): add dr elena v2 scenario fixtures`.

### 5. Draft Calculator Test Skeletons
- [ ] Create failing Jest tests:
  - `tests/calculations/instant-profile.test.ts`
  - `tests/calculations/compliance-snapshot.test.ts`
  - `tests/calculations/refinance-outlook.test.ts`
- [ ] For each file, import fixtures, assert `TODO` values (use `expect(() => calculate...).toThrow('Not implemented')` until implementation exists).
- [ ] Document persona references in test descriptions, e.g., `it('aligns with Dr Elena v2 first-time buyer scenario (test_scenarios.scenario_1)')`.
- Commit: `test(calculations): scaffold dr elena alignment tests (failing)`.

### 6. Review Existing Code Hooks
- [ ] Examine `lib/calculations/mortgage.ts` (if exists) or current instant calculator location.
- [ ] Document in the audit matrix where code diverges from persona expectations (e.g., missing rounding).
- [ ] Record action items in `docs/reports/DR_ELENA_V2_CALCULATION_MATRIX.md` under a “Gaps” section.
- Commit if doc updated: `docs: log current calculator gaps`.

### 7. Validate Implementation Plan Coverage
- [ ] Cross-check each workstream in the implementation plan against audit findings:
  - Does Step 2 workstream mention CPF/cash rounding? If not, add detail.
  - Does Step 3 new purchase include MSR/TDSR rounding? Add specifics.
  - Does Step 3 refinance cover objectives, cash-out gating, and property-use toggles? Add explicit acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Append acceptance criteria bullets to the plan where missing.
- [ ] Add a “Persona Verification Checklist” section summarising items to confirm during implementation.
- Commit: `docs: enrich implementation plan with persona acceptance criteria`.

### 8. Update Documentation Trails
- [ ] Update `docs/work-log.md` with audit progress, highlighting completed steps and remaining work.
- [ ] If new insights affect other docs (e.g., `docs/reports/INSTANT_CALCULATION_STRATEGY_v2.md`), add TODO markers referencing this audit.
- Commit: `docs: journal dr elena audit findings`.

### 9. Final Review & Handoff
- [ ] Re-run `npm run lint` to ensure docs/tests compile (even though tests still failing intentionally).
- [ ] Summarise outcomes in `docs/reports/DR_ELENA_V2_CALCULATION_MATRIX.md` (Conclusion section).
- [ ] Prepare a handoff note (in PR description or separate markdown) highlighting:
  - Persona rules confirmed.
  - Tests drafted.
  - Gaps requiring implementation changes.
- [ ] Share findings with Brent before implementation begins; await confirmation.
- Commit: `docs: finalize dr elena v2 audit prep`.

## Testing Notes
- Jest tests will remain red (expected) until calculator implementation exists. Mark them with `.todo` or keep failing with clear messages (preferred for TDD).
- No UI tests should be touched during audit; focus is on calculation accuracy.
- Use `npm run lint` to catch markdown or TypeScript issues introduced during audit.

## Success Criteria
- Persona rules fully documented and cross-referenced in the implementation plan.
- Fixture files and failing tests prepared for calculator development.
- All gaps and open questions surfaced to Brent with actionable notes.
- Audit documentation easily understandable by any developer joining the project.
