## 📋 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Form Gate Structure
```typescript
Gate 0: Loan Type Selection
  Fields: loanType ('new_purchase' | 'refinance' | 'commercial')
  Submission: No backend call

Gate 1: Basic Information  
  Fields: name, email
  Submission: No backend call

Gate 2: Contact & Core Details
  Fields: phone, propertyCategory (new), loan-specific fields
  Submission: AI processing (replacing n8n)
  
Gate 3: Optimization Parameters (NEW)
  Fields: monthlyIncome, existingCommitments, preferences
  Submission: Full AI analysis
```

### AI Agent Processing Flow
```
Gate 2 Completion:
├── SituationalAnalysisAgent.analyze()
├── RateIntelligenceAgent.generateIntelligence()
└── CompetitiveProtectionAgent.gateInformation()

Gate 3 Completion:
├── SituationalAnalysisAgent.enhanceWithFinancials()
├── DynamicDefenseAgent.generateDefenseStrategy()
└── PrepareBrokerConsultation()
```

### Property Routing Logic
```
new_purchase + propertyCategory:
├── 'resale' → Resale-specific fields
├── 'new_launch' → New launch fields  
├── 'bto' → BTO application fields
└── 'commercial' → Skip Gate 3, direct to broker

commercial (loan type):
└── After Gate 2 → Direct broker handoff
```

### Key Decisions Made
1. ✅ Commercial remains as loan type (broker routing)
2. ✅ Equity loan removed (AI handles cash equity)
3. ✅ Decoupling is AI-inferred (not form fields)
4. ✅ Gate 3 = Optimization Parameters (not just financial)
5. ✅ Replace n8n with local AI agents
