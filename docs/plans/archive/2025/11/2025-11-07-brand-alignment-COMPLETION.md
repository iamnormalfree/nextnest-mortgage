## Outcomes Achieved

### 1. Homepage Brand Alignment (Plan #1)

**What was completed:**
- ‚úÖ Hero section updated to "Evidence-based mortgage advisory"
- ‚úÖ Trust strip metrics grounded (16 Banks, 50+ Scenarios, 24hr Analysis)
- ‚úÖ Trust Bridge section added (black background, no CTA button)
- ‚úÖ Footer implemented (4-column minimal professional)
- ‚úÖ Yellow reduction applied (Rule of Two compliant)
- ‚úÖ All superlatives removed ("Singapore's Smartest" ‚Üí evidence-based positioning)
- ‚úÖ System exposure eliminated (no "Why Intelligence Matters" or "Intelligent Solutions")

**Impact:**
- Brand voice consistent across entire homepage
- Legal/compliance risk reduced (grounded claims only)
- Professional Swiss Spa aesthetic achieved
- 549 lines total (manageable complexity)

**Completed (2025-10-29):**
- ‚úÖ Manual QA testing completed at all viewport sizes (375px/768px/1440px)
- ‚úÖ QA Report: `docs/test-reports/2025-10-29-homepage-brand-alignment-qa.md`
- ‚úÖ Screenshots: `.playwright-mcp/homepage-{mobile|tablet|desktop}-{size}.png`
- ‚úÖ All success criteria verified: Hero, colors, sections, claims, layout, build
- ‚úÖ **Status: APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

---

### 2. Form & Chat Brand Alignment (Plan #2)

**What was completed:**
- ‚úÖ Form headlines professional (no "Let's get to know you")
- ‚úÖ Chat empty state human-centered ("Analysis not ready yet")
- ‚úÖ Chat CTA outcome-focused ("Start Your Analysis")
- ‚úÖ Singapore placeholders (Tan Wei Ming, 9123 4567)
- ‚úÖ PDPA + timeline disclosures visible

**Impact:**
- Sophisticatedly accessible tone throughout form flow
- Reduced form abandonment anxiety (timeline + privacy messaging)
- Singapore-context fluency demonstrated

**Deferred:**
- Manual testing of complete form flow across viewports

---

### 3. Loan Selector & CTA Alignment (Plan #3)

**What was completed:**
- ‚úÖ Trust Bridge repurposed (black section, no button)
- ‚úÖ Loan selector embedded in homepage view state
- ‚úÖ Copy updated ("Choose your scenario" visible in implementation)
- ‚úÖ Badge colors compliant (Rule of Two)
- ‚úÖ /apply page preserved (correct - it's the actual progressive form)

**Impact:**
- Eliminated redundant CTA (no confusion for users)
- Homepage maintains appropriate length
- Visual rhythm established (alternating light/dark sections)
- No unnecessary intermediate pages

**Clarification:**
- /apply deletion was misunderstood in original plan - /apply is the correct progressive form page, not redundant

**Deferred:**
- Manual click-through testing of all loan type cards

---

### 4. Form Navigation Standardization (Plan #4)

**What was completed:**
- ‚úÖ FormNav component created (`components/layout/FormNav.tsx` - 90 lines)

- ‚úÖ "Back to Home" direct link (not browser back)
- ‚úÖ "Get Started" conditional rendering
- ‚úÖ Chat navigation fixed (`router.replace()` at line 1587)
- ‚úÖ Navigation guard implemented (popstate handler lines 19-33)

**Impact:**
- Consistent navigation across all form pages
- Chat back button loop eliminated
- Clear exit path from form flow
- Professional UX pattern established

**Deferred:**
- End-to-end navigation testing (Homepage ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Form ‚Üí Chat ‚Üí Back)

## Decisions Made

### 1. Footer Design (Homepage)
**Decision:** 4-column minimal professional (Option A)
**Why:** Legal compliance + trust signals without overwhelming
**Location:** `app/page.tsx` lines 492-546

### 2. Trust Bridge Section (Homepage)
**Decision:** Keep section but remove CTA button
**Why:** Maintains homepage length, provides visual break, reinforces trust before conversion
**Alternative rejected:** Delete section (would make homepage "too thin")

### 3. /apply Page Preservation
**Decision:** Keep /apply page (not delete)
**Why:** It's the actual progressive form page, not redundant
**Clarification:** Original plan misunderstood the architecture

### 4. Chat Navigation Pattern
**Decision:** `router.replace()` + popstate guard
**Why:** Prevents back button loop, clear exit path to homepage
**Alternative rejected:** History manipulation alone (insufficient)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Revert all brand alignment changes
git log --oneline --grep="brand alignment" --grep="FormNav" --grep="Trust Bridge"
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or revert individual files
git checkout HEAD~1 -- app/page.tsx
git checkout HEAD~1 -- components/layout/FormNav.tsx
git checkout HEAD~1 -- app/chat/page.tsx
```

---

## Remaining Work

### Must Complete (Next Session)
1. **Manual QA Testing:**
   - Homepage scroll test (375px/768px/1440px)
   - Form flow test (complete Steps 1-4)
   - Chat navigation test (form ‚Üí chat ‚Üí back ‚Üí homepage)
   - Card click test (all 3 loan types ‚Üí /apply with correct param)

2. **Evidence Collection:**
   - Screenshots of before/after for work log
   - Lighthouse scores for homepage
   - Bundle size verification

### Nice to Have (Future)
- A/B test evidence-based positioning vs previous copy
- User testing feedback on Swiss Spa aesthetic
- Analytics on form abandonment rate changes

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- ‚úÖ 3-tier documentation system worked perfectly (plans ‚Üí runbooks ‚Üí code)
- ‚úÖ Breaking into 4 focused plans improved manageability
- ‚úÖ Runbook extraction kept plans under 250-line limit
- ‚úÖ All brand violations systematically eliminated

### What Could Be Improved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial plan misunderstood /apply page purpose (architectural confusion)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Build cache issue caused false type error (cleared with `rm -rf .next`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual testing should be scheduled immediately after implementation

### Process Improvements
- üîÑ Always verify architecture before planning deletions
- üîÑ Clear build cache proactively when seeing type errors
- üîÑ Schedule QA time as part of plan estimates
