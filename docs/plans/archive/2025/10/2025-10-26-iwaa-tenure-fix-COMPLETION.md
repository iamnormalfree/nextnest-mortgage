# Completion: IWAA & 55% LTV Tenure Fix

## What We Built

- **IWAA calculation for joint applicants**: Weighted age formula `(Age1 × Income1 + Age2 × Income2) / (Income1 + Income2)` with Math.ceil() rounding
- **55% LTV extended tenure rules**: Longer tenure caps for safer borrowers across all property types (HDB, EC, Private, Commercial)
- **Backwards compatibility**: Single applicant scenarios continue to work using optional `ages[]` and `incomes[]` parameters

## Metrics

- Tests: 6/6 (IWAA rounding) → 21/21 (integration + rounding)
- Property type coverage: 1 (HDB only) → 4 (HDB, EC, Private, Commercial)
- LTV tier support: 1 (75% only) → 2 (75% + 55% extended)
- Joint applicant tenure calculation: Broken → Working (IWAA-based)

## What Worked

- **TDD approach**: Writing 15 failing integration tests first caught interface issues immediately
- **Backwards compatibility**: Making ages/incomes optional preserved existing single-applicant functionality
- **Property-specific logic**: Separate formulas for each property type + LTV tier made implementation clear and maintainable
- **Comprehensive testing**: 22 test cases covering all scenarios + edge cases (old applicants, zero income co-applicant, mismatched arrays)
- **Browser testing**: Playwright verification confirmed form data flows correctly through all 4 steps

## What Didn't Work

- **Initial complexity assessment**: Started as MEDIUM (3/12), revised to HEAVY (5/12) after reading 2,614-line implementation guide
- **Dev server logs**: IWAA debug logging wasn't visible in dev-server.log (may require console.log changes or log file wasn't flushed)

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified (97 lines added/changed)

- `lib/calculations/instant-profile.ts`: +97 lines (IWAA tenure calculation, 55% LTV formulas, property-specific logic)
- `hooks/useProgressiveFormController.ts`: +44 lines (co-applicant data extraction, array parsing, validation)
- `lib/calculations/__tests__/iwaa-tenure-integration.test.ts`: New file (15 integration tests across 8 scenarios)
- `docs/work-log.md`: Updated with completion entry

### Commits

1. `3086d9e` - test: add IWAA tenure integration tests (failing) + feat: add ages/incomes to interface
2. `1b65316` - feat: implement IWAA-based tenure calculation
3. `94af73e` - feat: pass co-applicant ages/incomes for IWAA calculation
4. `729b48b` - docs: update work log with IWAA tenure fix completion

### Test Results

- ✅ All 21 tests passing (6 IWAA rounding + 15 integration)
- ✅ No regressions in existing tests
- ✅ TypeScript compiles successfully
- ✅ Browser testing: Form successfully submits with joint applicant data (verified with Playwright)

### Example Impact

**Before (WRONG):**
```
Primary: Age 50, Income $10k | Co-applicant: Age 30, Income $2k
→ Uses age 50 only → Tenure: MIN(65-50, 25) = 15 years
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
IWAA = (50×10000 + 30×2000) / 12000 = 47 (weighted average)
→ Tenure: MIN(65-47, 25) = 18 years → **3 years longer** → Higher max loan ✅
```

## Out of Scope (Deferred)

These remain separate tasks for future work:

1. **LTV tier auto-detection**: Form doesn't auto-switch to 55% LTV yet (needs MAS trigger logic)
2. **MasReadiness sidebar UI updates**: Display corrected max loan more prominently
3. **Refinancing tenure rules**: Different formula `MIN(original_tenure - years_elapsed, caps)`
