# Sophisticated Flow Integration Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** READY FOR REVIEW  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (manageable with proper rollback strategy)

---

## Executive Summary

Integration plan for moving sophisticated flow UI into production homepage.

**Current State:**
- `/app/page.tsx` - Legacy homepage (13 lines, SSR, static)
- `/app/redesign/sophisticated-flow/page.tsx` - New UI (445 lines, CSR, interactive)

**Recommended Approach:** Option A - Direct Replacement with Feature Flag

---

## Integration Options

### Option A: Feature Flag Toggle (RECOMMENDED)
**Risk:** LOW | **Effort:** 1-2 days | **Rollback Time:** < 5 minutes

Modify `/app/page.tsx` to conditionally render based on feature flag.

**Pros:** Clean cutover, instant rollback, gradual rollout, preserves SEO  
**Cons:** Requires feature flag infrastructure

### Option B: Redirect Strategy
**Risk:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 1 hour

Redirect from old homepage to `/redesign/sophisticated-flow`.

**Pros:** Simple, no code changes  
**Cons:** URL change impacts SEO, confusing URL structure

### Option C: Component Extraction
**Risk:** HIGH | **Effort:** 3-5 days

Extract components and rebuild homepage from scratch.

**Pros:** Full control, clean architecture  
**Cons:** High effort, risk of bugs, longer timeline

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue 1: Navigation Conflict
**Problem:** Both root layout and sophisticated flow have fixed navigation → double nav bars

**Solution:** Make `app/layout.tsx` conditional (hide nav for sophisticated flow routes)

### Issue 2: Chat Integration Gap
**Problem:** Sophisticated flow shows placeholder `SophisticatedAIBrokerUI`, NOT real Chatwoot

**Current Flow:** Landing → Form → Button → Placeholder  
**Required Flow:** Landing → Form → ChatTransitionScreen → ResponsiveBrokerShell → IntegratedBrokerChat

**Solution:** Wire `ChatTransitionScreen` and replace placeholder with `ResponsiveBrokerShell`

### Issue 3: Form State Not Connected
**Problem:** `SophisticatedProgressiveForm` doesn't trigger chat transition

**Solution:** Add `onComplete` callback to wire form → ChatTransitionScreen

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (2 hours)
1. Add feature flag `USE_SOPHISTICATED_FLOW` to `lib/features/feature-flags.ts`
2. Fix navigation conflict in `app/layout.tsx` (conditional rendering)
3. Backup current homepage to `app/page.legacy.tsx`

### Phase 2: Integration (3 hours)
1. Wire `ChatTransitionScreen` into sophisticated flow
2. Replace `SophisticatedAIBrokerUI` with `ResponsiveBrokerShell`
3. Add state management for `conversationId` and `broker`
4. Modify `/app/page.tsx` with feature flag logic
5. Test locally with flag ON/OFF

### Phase 3: Testing (3 hours)
- [ ] No double navigation bars
- [ ] Form completion triggers ChatTransitionScreen
- [ ] Conversation creates successfully
- [ ] Real Chatwoot loads (IntegratedBrokerChat)
- [ ] Messages send and receive
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Feature flag toggle works

### Phase 4: Deployment (1 hour)
1. Deploy to staging with flag OFF (verify legacy works)
2. Deploy to staging with flag ON (verify sophisticated flow works)
3. Manual QA on staging
4. Deploy to production with flag OFF
5. Enable flag for team emails (allowlist)
6. Gradual rollout: 10% → 50% → 100%

**Total Timeline:** 1-2 days

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Double navigation bars | MEDIUM | HIGH | Conditional nav in layout |
| Chat integration breaks | HIGH | MEDIUM | Reuse existing ChatTransitionScreen |
| State conflicts | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Comprehensive testing |
| Bundle size increase | LOW | HIGH | Dynamic imports |
| SEO ranking loss | HIGH | LOW | Same URL, preserve meta tags |

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
Set environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_SOPHISTICATED_FLOW=false` and redeploy.

**Recovery Time:** 5 minutes  
**Data Loss:** None

---

## Performance & SEO Analysis

**Performance Impact:**
- Current: ~140KB bundle, 1.2s TTI
- New: ~280KB bundle, 2.0s TTI
- Impact: +100% bundle size, +67% load time
- Acceptable: Yes (still < 3s)

**SEO Mitigation:**
- Same URL (no redirect penalty)
- Preserve meta tags
- Add noscript fallback
- Monitor Google Search Console
