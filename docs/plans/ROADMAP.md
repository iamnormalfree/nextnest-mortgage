# NextNest Product Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Phase 1 in progress
**Vision:** Transform mortgage decisions from overwhelming to empowering through transparent AI guidance

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Build foundation first, then scale with content, then add advanced features.

**Phases:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6):** Core experience - form, calculations, broker handoff
- **Phase 1.5 (Weeks 7-8):** Content foundation - regulatory compliance, insights library
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 9-12):** Content generation + scale - blog, SEO, lead gen
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 13+):** Advanced features - personalization, predictions, automation

**Rule:** Never archive this file. Plans come and go, but the roadmap persists.

---

## Deferred / Out of Scope

### Campaign Pages - ARCHIVED 2025-10-17
- **Reason:** Simple standalone calculator (`SingaporeMortgageCalculator.tsx`) and campaign pages (Reddit, LinkedIn, HWZ) archived
- **Decision:** Focus on core progressive form at `/apply` instead of separate campaign landing pages
- **Location:** `app/archive/2025-10/campaigns/`, `app/archive/2025-10/calculators/`

### Validation Dashboard - ARCHIVED 2025-10-17
- **Reason:** Internal debugging tool, no user integration
- **Location:** `app/archive/2025-10/validation-dashboard/`

### PDF Report Generation - ARCHIVED 2025-10-17
- **Reason:** Unfinished feature, zero frontend integration
- **Decision:** Use AI broker chat + email for personalized reports instead
- **Location:** `app/archive/2025-10/api/generate-report/`

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

- [ ] Extract mobile-specific patterns into shared utilities

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-17: Archive Simple Calculator
**Decision:** Archive `SingaporeMortgageCalculator.tsx` and campaign pages
**Reason:** Focus on core `/apply` progressive form instead of multiple entry points
**Impact:** Campaign traffic will redirect to `/apply?loanType=...`

### 2025-10-17: Migrate to instant-profile.ts
**Decision:** Migrate AI broker backend from `dr-elena-mortgage.ts` to `instant-profile.ts`
**Reason:** instant-profile.ts uses dynamic Dr Elena v2 constants, dr-elena-mortgage.ts uses hardcoded values
**Impact:** Backward compatibility maintained via adapters, gradual migration recommended

### 2025-10-17: Merge Bloomberg + NextNest Design Tokens
**Decision:** Archive `tailwind.bloomberg.config.ts`, keep merged `tailwind.config.ts`
**Reason:** All useful Bloomberg tokens (12 colors) successfully merged into main config
**Impact:** Single source of truth for design system, no breaking changes

### 2025-10-17: Keep AI Broker Mobile Variants
**Decision:** Preserve all 3 mobile AI assistant variants (standard, compact, fixed)
**Reason:** Active plan `mobile-ai-broker-ui-rebuild-plan.md` in progress, evaluation pending
**Impact:** Decision deferred until plan completion

## Questions / Clarifications Needed

1. **IPA Status Field:** Need to review form plans/runbooks to determine integration strategy
2. **Broker Assignment:** Needs algorithm refinement (currently manual/round-robin)
3. **Rate Data Source:** Which API/service for live mortgage rate data?
4. **Content Strategy:** SEO keywords and content calendar for Phase 1.5?
5. **Partnership Strategy:** Which property portals to prioritize in Phase 2?
