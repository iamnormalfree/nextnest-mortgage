# Railway Deployment Continuation Session

**Date:** October 12, 2025 (Continuation)
**Duration:** 4 debugging loops
**Engineer:** Brent (with Claude Code assistance)
**Goal:** Complete Railway deployment after initial fixes
**Outcome:** ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - Application deployed and accessible at nextnest.sg

---

## Executive Summary

This continuation session resolved the remaining Railway deployment issues after the initial build-time fixes. The application was building successfully but failing at runtime. Through systematic debugging across 4 loops, we identified and fixed:

1. **Missing environment variables** causing runtime crashes
2. **Redis module-level initialization** causing build failures
3. **Docker runtime dependencies** (node_modules not in runner stage)
4. **Healthcheck circular dependency** causing replica failures
5. **Custom domain port misconfiguration** preventing public access

**Final Result:** Application successfully deployed at https://nextnest.sg with all services operational.

---

## Problem Statement

**Initial State:**
- Previous session fixed build-time issues (Supabase lazy initialization)
- Application was building but deployment marked as "FAILED"
- 502 Bad Gateway errors on all requests
- Railway reporting: "Replicas never became healthy"

**Symptoms:**
- Build: ✅ Success
- Container Start: ✅ "Ready in 322ms"
- Runtime Requests: ❌ 502 errors
- Health Check: ❌ Failed

---

## Debugging Loop Summary

### Loop 1: Missing Environment Variables

**Investigation:**
- Deployed error-pattern-detective agent
- Analyzed Railway environment variables
- Identified missing NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

**Root Cause:**
```
Error: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is undefined
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
```

**Fix:**
```bash
railway variables --set "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ..."
railway variables --set "REDIS_URL=redis://..."
railway variables --set "NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://nextnest.sg"
```

**Result:** Build still failing - discovered railway.toml using Nixpacks instead of Dockerfile

---

### Loop 2: Redis Module-Level Initialization

**Investigation:**
- Build logs showed: `Error: REDIS_URL environment variable is required`
- Error occurred during `Collecting page data` phase
- API routes importing Redis queue/worker at module level

**Root Cause:**
Next.js build tries to statically analyze API routes, which imports broker-queue.ts and broker-worker.ts. These files initialized Redis connections at module level:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
export const brokerQueue = new Queue('broker-conversations', {
  connection: getRedisConnection(), // ← Executes at module level!
});
```

**Fix:** Applied lazy initialization pattern (matching Supabase fix):

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
let _brokerQueue: Queue | null = null;

export function getBrokerQueue(): Queue {
  if (!_brokerQueue) {
    _brokerQueue = new Queue('broker-conversations', {
      connection: getRedisConnection(),
    });
  }
  return _brokerQueue;
}
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `lib/queue/broker-queue.ts` - Queue lazy initialization
- `lib/queue/broker-worker.ts` - Worker lazy initialization
- `lib/queue/worker-manager.ts` - Updated to call getBrokerWorker()
- `.dockerignore` - Added to optimize build

**Commits:**
- `7e5178e` - Configure Railway to use Dockerfile builder
- `dde340f` - Convert Redis queue/worker to lazy initialization
- `4b46439` - Update worker-manager to use getBrokerWorker()

**Result:** Build succeeded! But healthcheck failing at runtime.

---

### Loop 3: Docker Runtime Dependencies

**Investigation:**
- Build succeeded
- Container started: `Ready in 418ms`
- Railway logs: `sh: next: not found`

**Root Cause:**
Dockerfile runner stage didn't copy node_modules, so when Railway tried to run `npm start`, the `next` binary wasn't available.

**Fix:**
```dockerfile
# Stage 3: Runner
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# ... existing setup ...

# Copy node_modules for production dependencies
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
```

**Commit:** `84dd992` - Add node_modules to Docker runner stage

**Result:** App starting successfully, but healthcheck still failing.

---

### Loop 4: Healthcheck Circular Dependency & Port Mismatch

**Investigation - Part A: Healthcheck Crash**

Railway reported: "Replicas never became healthy"

Analyzed `/api/health/chat-integration` endpoint:
- Calls `/api/analytics/conversion-dashboard` internally
- Analytics endpoint accesses Supabase/Redis
- Creates circular dependency during healthcheck
- Healthcheck crashes before app can be marked healthy

**Fix:** Created simple healthcheck endpoint without dependencies:

```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    version: process.env.npm_package_version || '1.0.0'
  });
}
```

Updated configurations:
- `railway.toml`: `healthcheckPath = "/api/health"`
- `Dockerfile`: Updated HEALTHCHECK to use `/api/health`

**Commit:** `5be18fb` - Simplify healthcheck endpoint

**Result:** App working on Railway domain (web-production-31144.up.railway.app) ✅

---

**Investigation - Part B: Custom Domain Not Working**

App working at: `https://web-production-31144.up.railway.app`
Not working at: `https://nextnest.sg` (502 errors)

**Root Cause:**
Custom domain configuration had wrong target port:
```json
{
  "domain": "nextnest.sg",
  "targetPort": 8080  // ← WRONG! App runs on 3000
}
```

**Fix:**
Updated Railway custom domain configuration:
- Changed targetPort from 8080 to 3000
- No code changes needed

**Result:** ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!**

---

builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ALWAYS"

[env]

PORT = "3000"
```

### Dockerfile (Key Changes)

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
RUN npm ci && npm cache clean --force

FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
# Copy standalone build
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
# Copy node_modules for runtime dependencies
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules

# Healthcheck (simple endpoint)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://localhost:3000/api/health', (r) => {process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)})"

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Custom Domain Configuration

**Railway Dashboard Settings:**
- Domain: `nextnest.sg`
- Target Port: **3000** (critical!)
- Service: web
- Environment: production

## Git Commit History (This Session)

```
5be18fb fix: Simplify healthcheck endpoint to prevent circular dependency crashes
84dd992 fix: Add node_modules to Docker runner stage for standalone mode
4b46439 fix: Update worker-manager to use getBrokerWorker() lazy getter
dde340f fix: Convert Redis queue/worker to lazy initialization for Railway Docker builds
7e5178e fix: Configure Railway to use Dockerfile builder instead of Nixpacks
```

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Railway.toml Builder Priority

Railway.toml builder setting takes precedence over auto-detection:
- `builder = "DOCKERFILE"` forces Docker build
- Without this, Railway may use Nixpacks (ignores Dockerfile)

### 2. Lazy Initialization Pattern (Critical)

**Any service accessing environment variables MUST use lazy initialization:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Executes at module level
export const service = new Service(process.env.API_KEY);

// ✅ GOOD - Executes only when called
let _service: Service | null = null;
export function getService() {
  if (!_service) {
    _service = new Service(process.env.API_KEY!);
  }
  return _service;
}
```

**Why:** Next.js imports all modules during build for static analysis. Environment variables aren't available at build time in Docker.

### 3. Docker Multi-Stage Build Requirements

For Next.js standalone mode:
- Stage 1 (deps): Install ALL dependencies (not just production)
- Stage 2 (builder): Copy node_modules, run build
- Stage 3 (runner): Copy standalone output + node_modules

**Why:** Standalone mode still needs some production dependencies at runtime.

### 4. Healthcheck Endpoint Design

**Don't:**
- ❌ Call other internal API endpoints
- ❌ Initialize services (DB, Redis, etc.)
- ❌ Perform complex health checks
- ❌ Use circular dependencies

**Do:**
- ✅ Return simple JSON response
- ✅ Include uptime/timestamp
- ✅ Keep timeout short (< 10s)
- ✅ Use dedicated `/api/health` endpoint

### 5. Railway Custom Domain Configuration

**Critical Settings:**
- Target Port MUST match application port
- Default Next.js port: 3000
- Misconfigured port = 502 errors
- Check: Railway dashboard → Service → Settings → Domains

### 6. Environment Variables: Build vs Runtime

**Build Time (NOT available):**
- During `npm run build`
- During Docker image creation
- During module-level imports

**Runtime (Available):**
- After container starts
- Inside function/component execution
- After lazy getter calls

---

## Debugging Methodology

### Systematic Approach Used

1. **Isolate the Stage:** Build → Start → Runtime → Routing
2. **Test Each Layer:**
   - Local build: `npm run build`
   - Docker build: `docker build`
   - Railway domain: Test Railway-provided URL first
   - Custom domain: Test after Railway domain works
3. **Agent Deployment:** Use specialized agents for complex analysis
4. **Loop Tracking:** Check in every 5 loops as requested

### Tools Used

- `railway logs` - Real-time deployment logs
- `railway status --json` - Deployment configuration
- `railway variables` - Environment variable management
- `curl` - Endpoint testing
- Error-pattern-detective agent - Log analysis
- Scalability-architect agent - Docker investigation

## Troubleshooting Future Issues

### If Build Fails

1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify all environment variables set: `railway variables`
3. Test local build: `npm run build`
4. Check for module-level initialization errors
5. Ensure railway.toml uses DOCKERFILE builder

### If Runtime Crashes (502)

1. Test Railway domain first (web-production-XXXXX.up.railway.app)
2. If Railway domain works: Check custom domain port configuration
3. If Railway domain fails: Check healthcheck endpoint
4. Verify REDIS_URL and SUPABASE environment variables
5. Check for circular dependencies in API routes

### If Healthcheck Fails

1. Test endpoint directly: `curl https://nextnest.sg/api/health`
2. Ensure endpoint is simple (no external calls)
3. Verify timeout is reasonable (<100s)
4. Check Railway healthcheck configuration
5. Review Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK command

### If Custom Domain Not Working

1. Verify target port matches application port (3000)
2. Check DNS records point to Railway
3. Verify SSL certificate is active
4. Test Railway-provided domain first
5. Check Railway dashboard → Domains settings
