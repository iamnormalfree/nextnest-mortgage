# Mobile Chat Integration Manual Test Report

**Date:** 2025-11-07
**Tester:** Implementation (TDD - No Manual Testing Required at This Stage)
**Environment:** Development (localhost:3000)
**Plan:** docs/plans/active/mobile-ai-broker-ui-rebuild-plan.md
**Constraint:** A – Public Surfaces Ready

---

## Test Objectives

Verify that the ResponsiveBrokerShell component correctly:
1. Routes to mobile UI on mobile viewports (375px) when feature flag enabled
2. Routes to desktop UI on desktop viewports (1440px) when feature flag enabled
3. Falls back to desktop UI everywhere when feature flag disabled
4. Passes props (conversationId, broker, formData) correctly to both UIs
5. Displays empty state when no conversationId is provided

---

## Test Setup

**Feature Flag:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOBILE_AI_BROKER=true` (in `.env.local`)

**Test URL:** `http://localhost:3000/chat?conversation=12345`

**Mock Data in SessionStorage:**
```json
{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```
