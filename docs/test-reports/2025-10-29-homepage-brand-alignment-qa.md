## Detailed Findings

### Brand Alignment Verification

**Hero Section:**
- ✅ Headline: "Evidence-based mortgage advisory."
- ✅ Subtext: "Built on real Singapore scenarios."
- ✅ Description: "We track 16 banks in real-time—you get only what fits your situation."
- ✅ No AI badge or tech stack exposure

**Trust Strip:**
- ✅ "16 Banks Tracked" (not "286 packages")
- ✅ "50+ Real Scenarios" (not "$1.2M Savings")
- ✅ "24hr Analysis Time" (not "99.9% Accuracy")

**Trust Bridge (Black Section):**
- ✅ Background: `rgb(0, 0, 0)` (pure black)
- ✅ Text: "Built on 50+ real Singapore scenarios"
- ✅ Copy: "Evidence-based methodology. Transparent calculations."
- ✅ No CTA button present

**Footer:**
- ✅ Column 1: Tagline ("Evidence-based mortgage advisory service") + Copyright
- ✅ Column 2: Legal (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service links)
- ✅ Column 3: Contact (hello@nextnest.sg)
- ✅ 4-column layout as specified

### Yellow Element Distribution

| Element | Location | Viewport Visibility |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| "Get Started" (nav) | Top navigation | Visible when scrolled to top |
| "Start Free Analysis" (hero) | Hero section | Visible in hero viewport |
| "SAVE AVG $34K" (badge) | Loan selector cards | Visible when scrolled to loan selector |

**Rule of Two Analysis:**
- At hero scroll position: 2 yellow elements visible (nav + hero button)
- At loan selector scroll position: 1-2 yellow elements visible (badge + possibly nav)
- **Never more than 2 in same viewport:** ✅ COMPLIANT

## Recommendations

### For Future Iterations

1. **Yellow Badge Optimization:**
   - Current: 3 yellow elements distributed across page
   - Consider: Making "SAVE AVG $34K" grey to reduce total yellow count to 2
   - Impact: Minimal (elements already separated by scroll distance)

2. **Trust Metrics Enhancement:**
   - Current: Static text for metrics
   - Consider: Add animated counters (already implemented in code, may need activation)

3. **Accessibility Audit:**
   - Verify ARIA labels for all interactive elements
   - Check color contrast ratios for grey text on white (`#666666` on `#FFFFFF`)
   - Test keyboard navigation through entire page
