/**
 * Worker Manager for Next.js
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Ensures BullMQ worker runs in server environment only and handles
 * lifecycle management for Railway/Vercel deployments.
 *
 * INTEGRATION NOTES:
 * - Called by: app/api/health/route.ts (auto-initializes worker)
 * - Uses singleton pattern to prevent multiple worker instances
 * - Handles graceful shutdown for production deployments
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * Workers MUST NOT run in client-side code or they will fail.
 * This manager ensures server-side only execution.
