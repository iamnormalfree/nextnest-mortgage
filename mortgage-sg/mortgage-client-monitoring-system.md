  Current Client Management System Overview

  Your system has a comprehensive, automated client identification and tracking workflow with three main components:

  1. Client Folder Workflow (CLIENT-FOLDER-WORKFLOW.md)

  Automatic Client Folder Creation:
  - When you run /analyze-client-psychology with a new client's WhatsApp message/screenshot, the system automatically:
    - Detects if a client folder exists (by name + phone)
    - Creates a new folder if none exists: /clients/JohnTan_9876/
    - Saves all conversations, psychology analysis, and tracking data

  Folder Structure Created:
  /clients/JohnTan_9876/
    ├─ profile.json                 # Client details (loan, property, income)
    ├─ psychology.json              # Buying psychology analysis
    ├─ conversations/
    │   ├─ 2025-10-09_initial.txt   # Conversation history
    │   └─ screenshots/
    ├─ analyses/
    │   ├─ 2025-10-09_LIGHT.json    # Rate recommendations
    │   └─ 2025-10-09_psychology.json
    ├─ closing_strategy.md          # Personalized closing strategy
    ├─ tracking.json                # Interaction tracking
    └─ outcome.json                 # WON/LOST status + what worked

  2. Client Identification System (CLIENT-IDENTIFICATION-SYSTEM.md)

  Multi-Layer Verification (100% precision goal):

  Before creating/updating folders, the system uses 5 search strategies:
  1. Exact Match: Name + phone number
  2. Fuzzy Match: Handles typos (Levenshtein distance)
  3. Phone Match: Full phone or last 4 digits
  4. Property Match: Same address/block
  5. Family Detection: Same surname + property (detects family members)

  Singapore-Specific Name Handling:
  - Parses English + Chinese names correctly
  - Handles variations: "Brent Ho Ming Xiu" vs "Brent Ho" vs "Ho Ming Xiu"
  - Accounts for name changes after marriage
  - Prevents duplicate folders for common surnames (Tan, Lim, Lee, Ng, Ong)

  Human-in-the-Loop Confirmation:
  - AI recommends: UPDATE (existing client) or CREATE (new client)
  - Shows previous context if match found
  - Requires your confirmation before proceeding

  3. Client Profile System (CLIENT-PROFILE-SYSTEM.md)

  Universal Client Profile Fields:

  Required (Minimum):
  - loanAmount: e.g., 800000
  - propertyType: "HDB" or "Private"
  - purchaseType: "New" or "Refinancing"
  - currentBank: (if refinancing)
  - currentRate: (if refinancing)

  Optional but Valuable:
  - monthlyIncome: For Treasures tier eligibility
  - liquidAssets: For AUM requirements
  - propertyAddress: Full address
  - urgency: Timeline for decision
  - preferredLockIn: 2 or 3 years

  WhatsApp Screenshot Extraction:
  The AI automatically extracts these fields from messages like:
  "Hi, looking to refinance my HDB. Current loan with UOB is $800k
  at 2.1%, still have 6 months lock-in left."

  4. Complete Workflow Example

  Step 1: Client Messages You
  # Upload WhatsApp screenshot
  /analyze-client-psychology [screenshot]

  Step 2: AI Verification (Automatic)
  - Extracts: Name, phone, property, loan details
  - Searches database for existing client
  - If found: Shows previous outcome, psychology, strategy
  - If not found: Confirms new client

  Step 3: You Confirm
  AI: "Found exact match: BrentHoMingXiu_9876
       Last contact: 2025-03-10 (Won - DBS 1.55%)
       Psychology: Price-Driven, Fast Decision Maker
       
       Recommend: UPDATE existing folder
       
       Confirm?"

  You: "Yes, update"

  Step 4: AI Creates/Updates Folder
  - Loads existing profile (if UPDATE)
  - Adds new conversation
  - Generates psychology analysis
  - Creates personalized closing strategy
  - Updates tracking log

  Step 5: Master Index Tracking
  - Updates /clients/_MASTER_INDEX/closing_patterns.json
  - Tracks close rates by psychology type
  - Monthly reports on what works/doesn't work
  - Objection library
