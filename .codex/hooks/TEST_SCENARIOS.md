## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Framework in Use ‚úÖ

**Context**:
```
User: "Fix the typo in README.md"
Assistant: [About to use Edit()]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: NONE
- Task() used: No
- Is orchestrator: No

**Result**: ‚úÖ **ALLOW** (silent)

**Reason**: No response-awareness framework in use, firewall doesn't interfere

---

### Scenario 2: LIGHT Tier - No Task() ‚úÖ

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-light Fix the login button color"
Assistant: [About to use Edit()]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: LIGHT
- Task() used: No
- Is orchestrator: No

**Result**: ‚úÖ **ALLOW** (silent)

**Reason**: LIGHT tier allows direct implementation when no Task() was used

---

### Scenario 3: LIGHT Tier - With Task() ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-light Add user validation"
Assistant: Let me investigate...
[Uses Task() to analyze requirements]
[Task returns with analysis]
Assistant: [About to use Edit() to implement]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: LIGHT
- Task() used: Yes
- Is orchestrator: Yes

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARN** (allow with warning)

**Message**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  ORCHESTRATOR FIREWALL - LIGHT TIER WARNING

You used Task() in this conversation, which makes you an ORCHESTRATOR.

LIGHT tier guideline:
- Direct implementation is OK if NO Task() was used
- But you HAVE used Task() ‚Üí Consider delegating instead

Recommendation: Deploy an implementation agent to maintain orchestrator role.

Press Enter to proceed anyway (deviation from framework)
```

---

### Scenario 4: MEDIUM Tier - No Task() ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-medium Add API endpoint"
Assistant: [About to use Edit() directly without using Task()]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: MEDIUM
- Task() used: No
- Is orchestrator: No

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARN** (allow with notice)

**Message**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  ORCHESTRATOR FIREWALL - MEDIUM TIER NOTICE

MEDIUM tier detected - You haven't used Task() yet.

Direct implementation is OK for MEDIUM tier if:
- Single straightforward change
- No Task() usage (you haven't used it)

Consider delegating if:
- Multi-file implementation
- Architectural changes needed

Proceeding is allowed
```

---

### Scenario 5: MEDIUM Tier - With Task() üõë

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-medium Refactor authentication system"
Assistant: Let me plan this...
[Uses Task() to explore approaches]
[Planning complete]
Assistant: [About to use Edit() to implement]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: MEDIUM
- Task() used: Yes
- Is orchestrator: Yes

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK**

**Message**:
```
üõë ORCHESTRATOR FIREWALL - BLOCKED

MEDIUM TIER - ORCHESTRATOR MODE DETECTED

State Detected:
- Tier: MEDIUM
- Task() usage: YES
- Role: ORCHESTRATOR

‚ùå Violation:
You used Task() for planning/analysis ‚Üí You are now an ORCHESTRATOR
Orchestrators NEVER implement directly.

Required Action:
Deploy implementation agent(s) instead:

    Task(
        subagent_type="general-purpose",
        description="Implement [feature]",
        prompt="<implementation details>"
    )

Why this matters:
Direct implementation DESTROYS your coordination capacity.
You lose ability to handle escalations and maintain architecture map.

‚ùå This tool usage will be BLOCKED.
```

---

### Scenario 6: HEAVY Tier - Phase 3 Transition üõë

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-heavy Implement character image system"
Assistant: ## Phase 1: Planning
[Deploys planning agents with Task()]
## Phase 2: Synthesis
[Synthesizes approaches]
## Phase 3: Implementation
[About to use Edit() to implement]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: HEAVY
- Phase: 3
- Task() used: Yes
- Is orchestrator: Yes

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK**

**Message**:
```
üõë ORCHESTRATOR FIREWALL - CRITICAL VIOLATION

HEAVY/FULL TIER - ORCHESTRATOR MODE

State Detected:
- Tier: HEAVY
- Phase: 3
- Task() usage: YES
- Role: ORCHESTRATOR

‚ùå CRITICAL RULE VIOLATION:
HEAVY/FULL tier orchestrators NEVER implement directly

This is a cognitive necessity, not just a guideline:
- Holding coordination map excludes holding implementation details
- Direct implementation destroys orchestration capacity
- You will lose ability to handle escalations

Phase Checkpoint:
Phase 3 - Implementation

Before implementing, answer:
1. Do I have a clear plan? (Phase 2 complete?)
2. Am I orchestrator or implementer? ‚Üí ORCHESTRATOR
3. How many files need changes? ‚Üí Deploy N agents

Required Action:
Deploy implementation agents:

    # For single file:
    Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
         description="Implement X in file.py",
         prompt="...")

    # For multiple files (deploy in parallel):
    Task(...)  # Agent 1: file1.py
    Task(...)  # Agent 2: file2.py
    Task(...)  # Agent 3: file3.py

‚ùå This tool usage is BLOCKED to protect orchestration integrity.
```

---

### Scenario 7: HEAVY Tier - No Task() Yet üõë

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-heavy Fix scaling issue"
Assistant: [Immediately tries to use Edit() without planning]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: HEAVY
- Task() used: No
- Is orchestrator: No (but should be)

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK**

**Message**:
```
üõë ORCHESTRATOR FIREWALL - HEAVY/FULL TIER BLOCK

HEAVY/FULL TIER DETECTED

State:
- Tier: HEAVY
- Task() usage: No (yet)

‚ö†Ô∏è  HEAVY/FULL Tier Requirement:
These tiers are orchestrator-only. All implementation must be delegated.

Workflow:
1. Planning Phase ‚Üí Deploy planning agents
2. Synthesis Phase ‚Üí Deploy synthesis agent
3. Implementation Phase ‚Üí Deploy implementation agents
4. Verification Phase ‚Üí Deploy verification agent

Direct implementation is not allowed in HEAVY/FULL tiers.

Action Required:
Deploy implementation agent(s) to maintain framework integrity.
```

**Reason**: HEAVY tier requires orchestration even without Task() usage

---

### Scenario 8: FULL Tier - Always Block üõë

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness Add authentication system"
[Router routes to FULL tier]
Assistant: [Any attempt to use Edit/Write/NotebookEdit]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: FULL
- Task() used: Varies
- Is orchestrator: Yes (FULL is always orchestrator)

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK**

**Reason**: FULL tier is orchestrator-only, never allows direct implementation

---

### Scenario 9: Deployed Agent - Allowed ‚úÖ

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-heavy Fix character rendering"
Orchestrator: ## Phase 3: Implementation
[Deploys implementation agent]

Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    description="Fix character image scaling",
    prompt="""
    You are implementing the character image scaling fix.

    Files: ui/screens/dialogue_screen.py
    Changes: Update scale_mode from 'contain' to 'fit'
    """
)

[Agent receives prompt and starts working]
Agent: [About to use Edit() to implement the fix]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: HEAVY (inherited from orchestrator)
- Task() used: Yes (by orchestrator)
- Is deployed agent: **YES** (detected from prompt pattern)

**Result**: ‚úÖ **ALLOW** (silent)

**Reason**: Deployed agents ARE implementers, they SHOULD use Edit/Write

**Detection Pattern**:
```python
# Firewall detects phrases like:
"You are implementing"
"You have been deployed to"
"subagent_type.*prompt.*Implement"
```

---

### Scenario 10: AUTO Router - Orchestrator Detected üõë

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness Investigate character image issues"
Router: [Assesses complexity, routes to HEAVY tier]
Assistant: [Uses Task() to deploy investigation agent]
Assistant: [About to use Edit() to implement findings]
```

**Firewall State**:
- Tier: AUTO (router)
- Task() used: Yes
- Is orchestrator: Yes

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK**

**Message**:
```
üõë ORCHESTRATOR FIREWALL - AUTO ROUTER BLOCK

AUTO ROUTER MODE - ORCHESTRATOR DETECTED

State:
- Mode: AUTO ROUTER
- Task() usage: YES

You used the /response-awareness router, which routed to a tier.
Since you used Task(), you are now an ORCHESTRATOR.

Action Required:
Deploy implementation agents instead of implementing directly.

Tool usage BLOCKED.
```

---

## Edge Cases & Special Scenarios

### Edge Case 1: Multiple Task() Calls

**Context**:
```
Task()  # Planning agent
Task()  # Another planning agent
Task()  # Synthesis agent
[About to use Edit()]
```

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK** (first Task() makes you orchestrator)

---

### Edge Case 2: Task() in Earlier Conversation

**Context**:
```
[Earlier conversation]
Task()  # Used 100 messages ago
[Current conversation]
[About to use Edit()]
```

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK** (Task() usage persists in conversation)

**Note**: Firewall scans entire conversation, not just recent messages

---

### Edge Case 3: Tier Switch Mid-Conversation

**Context**:
```
User: "/response-awareness-light Quick fix"
[Work starts]
User: "Actually, /response-awareness-heavy this is complex"
[About to use Edit()]
```

**Result**: üõë **BLOCK** (most recent tier is HEAVY)

**Detection**: Firewall uses MOST RECENT tier command

---

### Edge Case 4: Commenting About Task()

**Context**:
```
Assistant: "I could use Task() here, but I won't"
[About to use Edit()]
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **ALLOW**

**Reason**: Firewall looks for actual Task() invocation patterns:
- `Task(subagent_type=`
- `<invoke name="Task">`

Not just the word "Task()"

---

## Testing the Hook

### Manual Test 1: Simple LIGHT Allow

```bash
# Create test conversation
cat > test_light.txt << 'EOF'
User: /response-awareness-light Fix typo
Assistant: I'll fix the typo in the file.
EOF

# Run firewall
python .claude/hooks/orchestrator-firewall.py < test_light.txt
echo $?  # Should be 0 (allow)
```

### Manual Test 2: HEAVY Block

```bash
cat > test_heavy.txt << 'EOF'
User: /response-awareness-heavy Add feature
Assistant: Let me plan this.
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Plan feature")
Agent: [Planning complete]
Assistant: Now I'll implement.
EOF

python .claude/hooks/orchestrator-firewall.py < test_heavy.txt
echo $?  # Should be 1 (block)
```

### Manual Test 3: Deployed Agent Allow

```bash
cat > test_agent.txt << 'EOF'
User: /response-awareness-heavy Fix bug
Orchestrator: Deploying agent...
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
     prompt="You are implementing the bug fix in file.py")
Agent: I am implementing the fix.
EOF

python .claude/hooks/orchestrator-firewall.py < test_agent.txt
echo $?  # Should be 0 (allow - deployed agent)
```

### Debug Mode Testing

```bash
# Enable debug output
export DEBUG_FIREWALL=1

# Run test
echo "Task(subagent_type='test')" | python .claude/hooks/orchestrator-firewall.py

# Expected debug output:
# === Orchestrator Firewall Diagnostic ===
# Tool: Unknown
# Tier: NONE
# Phase: None
# Task() used: True
# Is Orchestrator: True
# Is Deployed Agent: False
# =========================================
```

---

## Expected Behavior Summary

### ‚úÖ ALLOW (Silent) - No Firewall Output

- No framework in use
- LIGHT tier without Task()
- Deployed agent implementing
- Appropriate context for direct implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN - Message + Allow

- LIGHT tier with Task() (suggest delegation)
- MEDIUM tier without Task() (consider delegation)

### üõë BLOCK - Message + Prevent Execution

- MEDIUM tier with Task() (orchestrator must delegate)
- HEAVY tier (always orchestrator)
- FULL tier (always orchestrator)
- AUTO router with Task() (orchestrator detected)

---

## Regression Tests

### Test Suite 1: Tier Detection

```python
# Test: Detect LIGHT tier
conversation = "/response-awareness-light Fix bug"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.tier == "LIGHT"

# Test: Detect HEAVY tier
conversation = "/response-awareness-heavy Complex feature"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.tier == "HEAVY"

# Test: No tier
conversation = "Just a normal conversation"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.tier == "NONE"
```

### Test Suite 2: Task() Detection

```python
# Test: Detect Task() usage
conversation = "Task(subagent_type='general-purpose', ...)"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.used_task == True

# Test: No Task() usage
conversation = "I'm implementing this directly"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.used_task == False
```

### Test Suite 3: Phase Detection

```python
# Test: Detect Phase 3
conversation = "## Phase 3: Implementation"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.phase == 3

# Test: No phase markers
conversation = "Working on feature"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall.phase == None
```

### Test Suite 4: Deployed Agent Detection

```python
# Test: Detect deployed agent
conversation = "You are implementing the fix in file.py"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall._is_deployed_agent() == True

# Test: Not deployed agent
conversation = "I am orchestrating the work"
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(conversation, "Edit")
assert firewall._is_deployed_agent() == False
```

---

## Performance Tests

### Benchmark: Conversation Parsing

```python
import time

# Small conversation (100 lines)
small_conversation = "\n".join(["line " + str(i) for i in range(100)])
start = time.time()
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(small_conversation, "Edit")
firewall.should_block()
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Small conversation: {elapsed*1000:.2f}ms")

# Large conversation (10,000 lines)
large_conversation = "\n".join(["line " + str(i) for i in range(10000)])
start = time.time()
firewall = OrchestratorFirewall(large_conversation, "Edit")
firewall.should_block()
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Large conversation: {elapsed*1000:.2f}ms")
```

**Expected**:
- Small (<100 lines): ~5-20ms
- Medium (100-1000 lines): ~20-100ms
- Large (1000-10000 lines): ~100-500ms

---

## Conclusion

The Orchestrator Firewall provides comprehensive protection against the "Just Do It" cognitive trap across all response-awareness tiers. These test scenarios demonstrate:

- ‚úÖ Tier-specific enforcement
- ‚úÖ Task() usage detection
- ‚úÖ Phase-aware guidance
- ‚úÖ Deployed agent recognition
- ‚úÖ Appropriate warnings vs blocks
- ‚úÖ Clear, actionable messages

**Result**: Framework rules become executable enforcement.
