CustomChatInterface QA Testing - Summary

Task: Test CustomChatInterface for desktop and mobile responsiveness
Result: PARTIAL - Tests created but blocked by routing issue

What Was Done:
1. Created Playwright test suite (e2e/chat-interface-responsive-qa.spec.ts)
2. Attempted 6 automated tests
3. Created QA report (docs/reports/CUSTOM_CHAT_INTERFACE_QA_REPORT.md)
4. Performed code analysis of component

Results:
- Automated Tests: 0/6 PASS (all timed out - test page 404)
- Code Analysis: 8/8 PASS (component well-structured)
- Component Quality: 4/5 stars
- Test Coverage: 2/5 stars (manual testing required)

Root Cause:
Next.js App Router treats directories with _ prefix as private.
Test page at /_dev/test-chat-interface returns 404.

Solution:
Rename app/_dev/ to app/(dev)/ to make test pages accessible.

Files Created:
- e2e/chat-interface-responsive-qa.spec.ts
- docs/reports/CUSTOM_CHAT_INTERFACE_QA_REPORT.md

Screenshots: Not generated (page inaccessible)

Next Steps:
1. Rename app/_dev to app/(dev)
2. Re-run Playwright tests
3. Capture screenshots
4. Execute manual QA checklist
