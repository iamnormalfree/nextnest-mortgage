# NextNest Mortgage Calculator Implementation Package

## Overview
This package contains the complete implementation files for NextNest's lead generation calculator system, ready for deployment by the development team.

## Current Strategic Direction

### Core Positioning
**Hero Message**: "The Only Mortgage Analysis That Thinks Like You Do"

- Client-centric (not industry-attacking)
- Two-tier value delivery system

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Tier 1 (Lead Gen)**: Impressive but strategic partial analysis
2. **Tier 2 (Full Service)**: Complete analysis through broker consultation only

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Field Mapping Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Use exact field names for n8n integration:
- `loanQuantum` (NOT `loanAmount`)
- `propertyType`: Must be 'HDB', 'Private', or 'Commercial' (case-sensitive)
- `timeline`: Must be 'immediate', 'soon', 'planning', or 'exploring'

### Webhook Endpoint
```javascript
POST https://[your-n8n-instance]/webhook/nextnest-leads
```

### Campaign Attribution
Each calculator variant must include proper source attribution:
```javascript
// Main calculator
source: 'website_calculator'
campaign: 'general'

// Reddit variant
source: 'reddit_calculator'
campaign: 'reddit_personalfinancesg'

// LinkedIn variant
source: 'linkedin_calculator'
campaign: 'linkedin_business_owners'

// HardwareZone variant
source: 'hardwarezone_calculator'
campaign: 'hardwarezone_property_forum'
```

## Testing Requirements

Before deployment, ensure:
1. All required fields present in webhook payload
2. Field names match exactly (particularly `loanQuantum`)
3. Property types correctly capitalized
4. Timeline values match enum options
5. Calculations match n8n logic
6. Mobile responsive design verified
7. Error states handled gracefully

## Compliance Notes

- TDSR limit: 55% (not 60%)
- MSR: Applies only to HDB (30% limit)
- Stress test rates: 4% residential, 5% commercial
- Conservative rounding: Always round up for client protection

## Support

- `JUNIOR_DEVELOPER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed steps
