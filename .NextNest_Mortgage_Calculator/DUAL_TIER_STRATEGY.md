# NextNest Dual-Tier Calculator Strategy
*Digital Strategy Council + MAS-Compliant Computational Framework*

## Strategic Overview

**The Challenge**: Balance lead generation effectiveness with calculation precision while positioning NextNest as "Your Personal Mortgage Brain" and protecting referral fee revenue.

**The Solution**: Two-tier calculator architecture that progressively builds trust and qualifies leads through increasing computational precision using MAS-regulation compliant methodologies.

## Tier 1: Lead Generation Calculators (Public Access)

### Purpose & Positioning
- **Primary Goal**: Lead capture and qualification while protecting full analysis value
- **Positioning**: "Your Personal Mortgage Brain Preview - Sophisticated Analysis Sample"
- **Revenue Protection**: Preview creates need for complete personal advisory consultation

### MAS-Compliant Precision Requirements for Lead Gen
```javascript
// Lead Gen Calculation Standards (Tier 1)
const leadGenPrecision = {
  stressTestRates: {
    residential: 4.0,  // MAS-compliant (not 3.5%)
    commercial: 5.0    // MAS-compliant
  },
  tdsrLimit: 0.55,     // Correct limit (not 0.60)
  roundingRules: {
    monthlyPayment: "Math.ceil()", // Conservative for client protection
    loanEligibility: "Math.floor(value/1000)*1000", // Round down to nearest K
  },
  disclaimers: [
    "Estimates based on MAS guidelines",
    "Precise analysis requires full financial review",
    "NextNest MAS-compliant computational methodology"
  ]
}
```

### Digital Strategy Enhancements
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic results, tease advanced features
2. **Authority Building**: "Your Personal Mortgage Brain - Analysis That Thinks Like You Do"
3. **Value Progression**: "Get Complete Personal Advisory Analysis (consultation required)"
4. **Trust Anchoring**: Display calculation methodology transparency

### Lead Scoring Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhanced Lead Scoring (Digital Strategy Council)
const advancedLeadScoring = {
  precisionInterest: {
    advancedOptionsClicked: +2,
    calculationMethodologyViewed: +1,
    disclaimerReadTime: "+1 if >30 seconds"
  },
  sophisticationIndicators: {
    multipleScenarioTesting: +2,
    commercialProperty: +3,
    complexFinancialStructure: +2
  },
  conversionReadiness: {
    contactInfoProvided: +3,
    consultationBooked: +5,
    precisionToolRequested: +4
  }
}
```

## Tier 2: Client AI-Assisted Tools (Gated Access)

### Access Requirements
- **Consultation Booked**: Full access after scheduling appointment
- **Lead Qualified**: High-score leads get limited access
- **Client Status**: Complete access for active NextNest clients

### NextNest's Full MAS-Compliant Computational Precision
```javascript
// Client Tool Calculation Standards (Tier 2)
const clientPrecision = {
  fullMASCompliance: {
    tdsrCalculation: "NextNest's MAS-regulation computational module",
    msrLimits: "Property-type specific with all exceptions",
    iwaaCalculation: "Multi-borrower income-weighted age",
    stressTestAccuracy: "Bank-specific rate structures"
  },
  
  advancedCalculations: {
    stampDutyCalculation: "Complete BSD/ABSD/SSD with all scenarios",
    efaModeling: "Pledge fund and show fund requirements", 
    progressivePayments: "BUC payment scheduling",
    equityTermLoans: "Charge priority analysis"
  },

  clientProtectiveRounding: {
    loanEligibility: "Math.floor(value/1000)*1000", // Down to nearest K
    fundsRequired: "Math.ceil(value/1000)*1000",    // Up to nearest K  
    monthlyPayments: "Math.ceil(value)",            // Up to nearest dollar
  }
}
```

### Digital Strategy Implementation

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
interface CalculatorTier {
  tier: 'lead_gen' | 'client_tool';
  precision: 'estimated' | 'mas_compliant';
  features: string[];
  accessLevel: 'public' | 'qualified_lead' | 'client';
}

// Progressive enhancement based on user status
const getCalculatorFeatures = (userStatus: string): CalculatorTier => {
  switch(userStatus) {
    case 'anonymous':
      return { tier: 'lead_gen', precision: 'estimated', features: ['basic'] };
    case 'qualified_lead':  
      return { tier: 'client_tool', precision: 'mas_compliant', features: ['advanced'] };
    case 'consultation_booked':
      return { tier: 'client_tool', precision: 'mas_compliant', features: ['full'] };
  }
}
```

### Backend Integration
```javascript
// n8n Workflow Enhancement
const calculationRouting = {
  leadGenPath: {
    calculations: 'nextnest_tier1_module',
    precision: 'market_estimate',
    output: 'lead_qualified_results'
  },
  clientToolPath: {
    calculations: 'nextnest_full_computational_module', 
    precision: 'mas_regulation_compliant',
    output: 'professional_analysis_report'
  }
}
```
