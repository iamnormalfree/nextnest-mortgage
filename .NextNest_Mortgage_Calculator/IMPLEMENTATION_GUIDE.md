```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. NextNest Integration

Replace the existing dashboard calculator with this enhanced version:

```bash
# Navigate to NextNest project
cd /path/to/NextNest

# Add the new calculator component
cp singapore-mortgage-calculator.tsx app/dashboard/page.tsx

# Add custom styles to global CSS
cat calculator-styles.css >> app/globals.css
```

### 2. Dependencies Required

The calculator uses NextNest's existing tech stack:
- âœ… React Hook Form (already installed)
- âœ… Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- âœ… TypeScript (already set up)

No additional dependencies needed!

### 3. n8n Webhook Configuration

**Webhook URL Structure:**
```
https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/nextnest-leads
```

**Expected Payload:**
```json
{
  "loanQuantum": 640000,
  "propertyValue": 800000,
  "currentBank": "DBS",
  "propertyType": "Private",
  "timeline": "immediate",
  "ltvRatio": 80.0,
  "potentialMonthlySavings": 247,
  "refinancingCostBenefit": 73890,
  "name": "John Tan",
  "email": "john@example.com",

  "source": "website_calculator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T12:00:00.000Z",
  "calculationResults": { /* full calculation object */ }
}
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Add to NextNest's `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/nextnest-leads
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://nextnest.sg
```

## Post-Launch Strategic Priority: Precision Tool Implementation

**CRITICAL**: After lead gen calculators are deployed, immediately begin building out the full precision tool (`nextnest-client-precision-tool.tsx`) as Tier 2 offering:

### Implementation Timeline:
1. **Week 1-2**: Deploy lead gen calculators (Tier 1 - 80% analysis)
2. **Week 3-4**: Integrate precision tool as "Complete Personal Advisory" (Tier 2 - 100% analysis)
3. **Week 5+**: Test two-tier conversion funnel and optimize

### Revenue Protection Strategy:
- **Tier 1** (Lead Gen): Impressive preview that creates need for deeper understanding
- **Tier 2** (Precision): Complete analysis only through personal advisory consultation
- **Positioning**: Progressive disclosure that feels like deepening relationship, not information withholding

### Banker Relationship Protection:
- Frame as "comprehensive client analysis" that helps banks make better decisions
- Avoid adversarial positioning - focus on client optimization, not bank criticism
- Position as specialist who enhances bank-client relationships

Thought some of you might find it useful for comparing your options."
[Link to calculator with UTM tracking]
```

### HardwareZone Property Forum

Position as technical expertise demonstration:
```
"For those discussing mortgage rates, I created a calculator that includes 
TDSR/MSR calculations and break-even analysis for refinancing."
```

### A/B Testing Framework

Easy variation testing:
```tsx
// Test different headlines
const headlines = {
  control: "Your Personal Mortgage Brain",
  variant: "The Mortgage Advisor That Thinks Like You Do"
};

// Test different guarantees  
const guarantees = {
  control: "48-hour analysis guarantee",
  variant: "24-hour guarantee or free bank connection"
};
```

## Mobile Optimization

The calculator is fully responsive with mobile-specific optimizations:
- Single-column form layout on mobile

```javascript
// Track calculation completions
gtag('event', 'mortgage_calculation_complete', {
  property_type: formData.propertyType,

});

// Track lead form submissions
gtag('event', 'lead_form_submit', {
  source: 'mortgage_calculator',
  timeline: formData.timeline,

});
```
