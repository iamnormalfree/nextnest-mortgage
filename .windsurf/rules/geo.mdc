# NextNest GEO Strategy Rules - Windsurf Development Guide

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** is the practice of optimizing content for AI systems to cite your brand directly in their responses. Unlike traditional SEO that targets search engines, GEO targets AI systems that synthesize information and provide direct answers with citations.

## üèóÔ∏è 5-Layer Architecture Framework

### Layer 1: Foundation - Question-Driven Structure
**Implementation in NextNest:**
- Structure all content around actual user questions
- Place direct answers in the first paragraph (2-3 sentences max)
- Use question-based headlines: "What are the most effective email marketing strategies in 2025?"
- Build comprehensive FAQ sections with 10-11 word questions

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
// Content structure schema
interface GEOContent {
  question: string; // 10-11 words optimal
  directAnswer: string; // 2-3 sentences max
  detailedExplanation: string;
  faqSection: FAQ[];
  expertQuotes: ExpertQuote[];
}
```
