# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

You are an experienced, pragmatic software engineer. Simple solutions over complex ones.

**Rule #1:** If you want an exception to ANY rule, STOP and get explicit permission from Brent first.

---

## Working Relationship

We're colleagues ("Brent" and "Claude") working together with honest, direct communication.

**Communication style:**
- Speak up immediately when you don't know something or we're in over our heads
- Call out bad ideas, unreasonable expectations, and mistakes - Brent depends on this
- Push back when you disagree. Cite technical reasons or just say it's a gut feeling
- If uncomfortable pushing back, say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Use your journal to capture insights before you forget them

**When to ask vs. just do it:**
- Just do obvious follow-ups needed to complete tasks properly
- Pause only when: multiple valid approaches exist, major code restructuring, genuinely unclear what's being asked
- Discuss architectural decisions (framework changes, major refactoring, system design) before implementing
- Fix broken things immediately - don't ask permission to fix bugs

---

## Critical Rules (Never Break These)

**Test Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY for all features/bugfixes:**
1. Write a failing test that validates the desired functionality
2. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
3. Write ONLY enough code to make the test pass
4. Run the test to confirm success
5. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

**Version Control:**
- NEVER skip, evade, or disable a pre-commit hook
- Commit frequently throughout development, even for WIP
- Stop and ask about uncommitted changes before starting new work
- Create WIP branch if no clear branch exists for the task

**Session Continuation Protocol:**
- When resuming work from previous session, ALWAYS check `git status` and `git branch` first
- If uncommitted changes exist AND new task is unrelated to current branch → offer worktree
- If unclear whether new task relates to current branch → ask before proceeding
- Use `/response-awareness "[task]"` for new work to trigger automatic safeguards (Phase 0 checks)

**Code Changes:**
- Make the SMALLEST reasonable changes to achieve the outcome
- NEVER throw away or rewrite implementations without explicit permission - STOP and ask first
- Match the style and formatting of surrounding code (consistency > standards)
- Don't manually change whitespace that doesn't affect execution

**Testing:**
- All test failures are your responsibility - fix them
- Never delete failing tests - raise the issue with Brent
- Never write tests that only test mocked behavior - warn Brent if you find these
- Never use mocks in end-to-end tests (use real data and APIs)
- Test output must be pristine to pass - capture and validate expected errors

---

## Code Standards

**Design:**
- YAGNI. Best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now
- When YAGNI allows, architect for extensibility

**Quality:**
- Simple, clean, maintainable > clever or complex
- Work hard to reduce code duplication
- Each file starts with 2-line "ABOUTME:" comment explaining what it does

**Naming & Comments:**
- Names tell what code does, not how it's implemented or its history
- No temporal context: "new", "old", "legacy", "improved", "enhanced", "wrapper"
- No implementation details: "ZodValidator", "MCPWrapper", "JSONParser"
- Domain names over patterns: `Tool` not `ToolFactory`, `execute()` not `executeToolWithValidation()`
- Comments explain WHAT/WHY, never "what it used to be" or "how it changed"
- Never add instructional comments ("copy this pattern", "use this instead")
- Preserve existing comments unless provably false

**Debugging:**
Always find root cause, never fix symptoms:
1. Read error messages carefully, reproduce consistently, check recent changes
2. Find working examples, compare differences, understand dependencies
3. Form single hypothesis, test minimally, verify before continuing
4. Have simplest failing test case, never add multiple fixes at once

## Project Quick Reference

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui + Supabase
**Design System:** Single `tailwind.config.ts` is source of truth for both NextNest brand and Bloomberg colors. Bloomberg config archived 2025-10-17 after successful merge of all 12 color tokens. See `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for complete design tokens and patterns.
**Architecture:** See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full project structure and patterns
**Known Issues:** See `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for current workarounds

**Common Commands:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # Code quality check
```

**Documentation:**
- Tech Stack: `docs/runbooks/TECH_STACK_GUIDE.md`
- Chatwoot: `docs/runbooks/chatops/CHATWOOT_COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- AI Broker: `docs/runbooks/AI_BROKER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
- Deployment: `docs/runbooks/devops/production-deployment-guide.md`
- Forms: `docs/runbooks/FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`

**Key Patterns:**
- Components: Self-contained in `components/` with TypeScript interfaces
- API routes: `app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts` with proper error handling
- Business logic: `lib/` directory for calculations and utilities
- Validation: Zod schemas for all form handling and data structures
- Performance: Target <140KB gzipped bundle size

## Component Placement Decision Tree

**Before creating ANY file in app/ or components/, answer these questions:**

### Question 1: Is this a test/development page?
- **YES** → Create in `app/_dev/[feature-name]/page.tsx`
  - Underscore prefix excludes from production builds
  - Examples: `app/_dev/test-mobile/`, `app/_dev/test-broker/`
- **NO** → Continue to Question 2

### Question 2: Is this experimental/in-progress code?
- **YES** → Create in `components/archive/YYYY-MM/[experiment-name]/`
  - Use date format: `2025-10`, `2025-11`
  - Add README explaining the experiment
- **NO** → Continue to Question 3

### Question 3: Is this a production page route?
- **YES** → Create in `app/[route-name]/page.tsx`
  - ✅ Allowed: `app/apply/`, `app/calculator/`, `app/chat/`
  - ❌ Forbidden: `app/test-*`, `app/temp-*`, `app/*.backup.tsx`
- **NO** → Continue to Question 4

### Question 4: Is this a reusable component?
- **YES** → Determine folder based on purpose:
  - **UI primitives** → `components/ui/[component-name].tsx` (Shadcn/ui components)
  - **Layout components** → `components/layout/[component-name].tsx` (Footer, Header, Nav)
  - **Landing page sections** → `components/landing/[SectionName].tsx` (Hero, Services, CTA)
  - **Shared utilities** → `components/shared/[component-name].tsx` (ErrorBoundary, icons, AnimatedCounter)
  - **Forms** → `components/forms/[component-name].tsx`
  - **Form sections** → `components/forms/sections/[section-name].tsx`
  - **Mobile forms** → `components/forms/mobile/[component-name].tsx`
  - **AI Broker** → `components/ai-broker/[component-name].tsx`
  - **Chat** → `components/chat/[component-name].tsx`
  - **Analytics** → `components/analytics/[component-name].tsx`
  - **Calculators** → `components/calculators/[component-name].tsx`
- **NO** → STOP - Reconsider if you need this file

### Question 5: Where do tests go?
- **Component tests** → `components/[folder]/__tests__/[ComponentName].test.tsx`
- **Integration tests** → `tests/[domain]/[feature].test.ts`
- **E2E tests** → `tests/e2e/[flow].test.ts`
- **Test fixtures** → `tests/fixtures/[data-set].ts`

### Question 6: What about backup files?
- **NEVER commit .backup.tsx files** - Use git history instead (`git show HEAD~1:path/to/file.tsx`)
- **Alternative implementation?** → Archive to `components/archive/YYYY-MM/[descriptive-name].tsx`

### Forbidden Patterns
- ❌ `app/test-*` pages (use `app/_dev/` instead)
- ❌ `app/temp-*` pages (use `app/_dev/` or delete)
- ❌ `*.backup.tsx` files (use git history)
- ❌ Top-level components without clear domain (organize into subfolders)
- ❌ Random subfolders without 3+ related files

---

## Response-Awareness & Skills Architecture

**CRITICAL: Understanding the layered AI assistance system**

### Three-Layer System

**Layer 1: Upstream Reference** (`.claude/upstream-reference/`)
- Pristine copies of response-awareness framework from GitHub
- Used for comparison when syncing updates
- **NEVER modify** - reference only
- Download new versions here for manual comparison

**Layer 2: Configuration** (`.claude/config/`)
- `response-awareness-config.json` - Feature flags, paths, tier settings
- `logging-config.json` - Verbose logging, learning mode
- `agents-config.json` - Custom agents, model preferences
- **Modify freely** - these are your settings

**Layer 3: Working Files** (`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`)
- Your customized versions with NextNest integrations
- May differ from upstream (worktree checks, CLAUDE.md compliance, etc.)
- **Modify carefully** - preserve customizations when syncing upstream

### Key Skills Available

**From Response-Awareness Framework:**
- `/response-awareness` - Universal router (complexity assessment → tier routing)
- `response-awareness-light` - Single file, fast execution
- `response-awareness-medium` - Multi-file, optional planning
- `response-awareness-heavy` - Complex features, full planning
- `response-awareness-full` - Multi-domain architecture

**From Superpowers (adapted for NextNest):**
- `brainstorming` - Refine vague ideas into designs before planning
- `systematic-debugging` - Root cause investigation (NEVER skip this for bugs)

**NextNest Custom:**
- `worktree-helper` - Manage parallel development streams

### When to Use Each Skill

**For Bugs/Errors:**
```bash
# ALWAYS use systematic-debugging for ANY bug
# Router will detect debug keywords and offer this automatically
/response-awareness "Fix calculation returning NaN"
→ Detects "fix" keyword → Offers systematic-debugging skill → Root cause investigation
```

**For Vague Ideas:**
```bash
# Use brainstorming to clarify before implementation
/response-awareness "I'm thinking about adding a dashboard"
→ Detects "thinking about" → Offers brainstorming skill → Refine requirements → Plan → Implement
```

**For Clear Requirements:**
```bash
# Router assesses complexity and routes to appropriate tier
/response-awareness "Add email validation to signup form"
→ Complexity score: 2 → MEDIUM tier → Optional planning → Implementation
```

**For Parallel Work:**
```bash
# Uncommitted changes + new unrelated task = worktree offer
git status  # Shows uncommitted changes
/response-awareness "Add new feature X"
→ Detects uncommitted work → Offers worktree creation → Isolated workspace
```

### Configuration-Driven Behavior

All paths and features come from config files, NOT hardcoded:

```javascript
// Logging location (from logging-config.json)
const logPath = config.paths.verbose_logs;  // docs/completion_drive_logs

// Feature toggles (from response-awareness-config.json)
if (config.features.worktree_integration) {
  // Offer worktree when appropriate
}

if (config.features.brainstorming_precheck) {
  // Detect vague language and offer brainstorming
}
```

### Syncing with Upstream

**When response-awareness framework updates:**

1. Download latest ZIP from GitHub
2. Unzip to `.claude/upstream-reference/response-awareness-vX.X.X/`
3. Run comparison: `node scripts/compare-upstream.js vX.X.X`
4. Review differences (what changed upstream vs your customizations)
5. Manually merge improvements while preserving NextNest customizations
6. Update `.claude/config/response-awareness-config.json` upstream_version
7. Test: `/response-awareness "test task"`

**See:** [UPDATE_GUIDE.md](UPDATE_GUIDE.md) for full sync workflow

### NextNest Customizations to Preserve

**When syncing upstream, ALWAYS preserve:**

1. **Configuration Loading**
   - Config file paths
   - Feature flag checks
   - NextNest-specific settings

2. **Worktree Integration**
   - Phase 0 pre-checks
   - worktree-helper agent deployment

3. **Brainstorming Pre-Checks**
   - Vague language detection
   - Requirement clarification offers

4. **CLAUDE.md Compliance**
   - TDD enforcement
   - CANONICAL_REFERENCES checks
   - Component Placement Decision Tree
   - YAGNI ruthlessness

5. **Logging Paths**
   - `docs/completion_drive_logs/` (not upstream default)
   - Learning mode summaries
   - Plan persistence to `docs/plans/`

### Communication Style for Skills

**For Exploratory/Vague Requests:**
- Proactively offer brainstorming skill
- "I notice some ambiguity. Would you like structured brainstorming or conversational exploration?"

**For Bug Reports:**
- ALWAYS offer systematic-debugging
- "This appears to be a debugging task. Should I use systematic-debugging skill for root cause analysis?"

**For Clear Implementations:**
- Route through response-awareness automatically
- Announce tier: "Complexity assessment: MEDIUM tier (2-5 files, moderate integration)"

### Forbidden Patterns

❌ **Don't bypass skills when they apply:**
- Bug reported → Must offer systematic-debugging (don't jump to fixes)
- Vague idea → Offer brainstorming (don't assume requirements)
- Complex task → Use response-awareness tiers (don't implement ad-hoc)

❌ **Don't modify upstream reference files:**
- `.claude/upstream-reference/` is pristine - comparison only

❌ **Don't hardcode paths:**
- Always load from `.claude/config/*.json`

✅ **Do update configs when needs change:**
- Change logging verbosity → Edit `logging-config.json`
- Disable worktrees → Set `features.worktree_integration: false`
- Add custom agent → Update `agents-config.json`

---

## Planning & Documentation Workflow

**CRITICAL: One plan per feature. No proliferation.**

### 3-Tier Documentation System

**Before creating ANY documentation, understand the 3-tier hierarchy:**

**Tier 1: Code (Canonical Truth)**
- Location: Production code files listed in `CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md`
- Purpose: THE source of truth - actual implementation
- Examples: `instant-profile.ts`, `ProgressiveFormWithController.tsx`, `form-contracts.ts`
- Rule: **Check CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md before modifying ANY Tier 1 file**
- Change Process: Tests first → Update code → Update dependent files → Verify build

**Tier 2: Runbooks (Implementation Guides)**
- Location: `docs/runbooks/{domain}/`
- Purpose: HOW to implement features, linking to Tier 1 code
- Examples: `FORMS_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`, `AI_BROKER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
- Rule: **NEVER duplicate code from Tier 1** - link to it with file:line references
- Update: When Tier 1 code changes significantly

**Tier 3: Plans (Temporary Decision Documents)**
- Location: `docs/plans/active/` (then archived)
- Purpose: WHAT to build and WHY, temporary task tracking
- Max Length: 200 lines
- Rule: **Reference runbooks, never duplicate them** - link to runbooks for "how"
- Lifecycle: Created → Executed → Completed → Archived

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Never duplicate Tier 1 code** in runbooks or plans - link to it instead
2. **Check CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md** before modifying core files
3. **Runbooks never expire** - plans do (archive after completion)
4. **Plans reference runbooks** - don't contain full implementation guides
5. **Never create new tiers** - everything fits into these 3 levels

**Examples:**
- ✅ Plan says: "Update instant-profile.ts calculation (see CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md for rules)"
- ✅ Runbook says: "See instant-profile.ts:245 for TDSR calculation implementation"
- ❌ Plan contains full code examples from instant-profile.ts
- ❌ Runbook duplicates calculation logic from instant-profile.ts

### Planning Rules

**File format:** `docs/plans/active/{date}-{feature-slug}.md`

**Maximum length: 200 lines**
- If longer, split into multiple plans OR extract to runbook
- Plans contain DECISIONS (what to build, why, testing)
- Plans do NOT contain INSTRUCTIONS (code examples, tutorials)

**Required sections:**
```yaml
---
status: draft | active | completed
complexity: light | medium | heavy
estimated_hours: X
---

# Feature Name

## Problem (2-3 sentences)
What are we solving?

## Success Criteria (3-5 measurable outcomes)
- Outcome 1
- Outcome 2

## Tasks (5-15 tasks, each <2h)
- [ ] Task 1 (test file, doc link if needed)
- [ ] Task 2

## Testing Strategy
Unit/Integration/E2E: which files

## Rollback Plan
How to undo if it fails
```

**Red flags your plan is too long:**
- Contains code examples >20 lines
- Contains "read this first" prerequisites
- Contains troubleshooting sections
- Contains copy-paste tutorials
- Over 200 lines

**When plan grows too large:**
1. Extract code examples → delete or move to `docs/runbooks/`
2. Extract tutorials → link to existing runbook
3. Split into Phase 1, Phase 2 plans if still >200 lines

**Before creating a new plan:**
1. Check `docs/plans/active/` - does a plan for this feature already exist?
2. If yes, update existing plan instead of creating new one
3. If creating new plan, set old related plans to `status: archived` and move them

**Pre-implementation checklist (add to every plan):**
```markdown
## Pre-Implementation Checklist

**Before starting implementation:**
- [ ] Check CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md for folder structure standards
- [ ] Verify no Tier 1 files will be modified (if yes, review change rules)
- [ ] Confirm file placement using Component Placement Decision Tree (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Check for existing similar components/features to avoid duplication
- [ ] Identify which tests need to be written first (TDD)
- [ ] Review related runbooks for implementation patterns

**File placement decisions:**
- [ ] New app/ routes → Production route or app/_dev/?
- [ ] New components → Which domain folder? (ui, layout, landing, shared, forms, etc.)
- [ ] New tests → Colocated __tests__/ or tests/ directory?
- [ ] New utilities → lib/ or hooks/?
- [ ] Archive format → YYYY-MM if archiving anything
```

### Execution Rules

**During implementation, use ONLY:**
- `TodoWrite` tool for task tracking
- `docs/work-log.md` for daily notes
- Git commits as execution log
- Nothing else

**DO NOT create during execution:**
- New plans
- Investigation reports (use journal)
- Status updates (use journal)
- Fix summaries (git log is your summary)

**Update work-log.md structure:**
```markdown
## {YYYY-MM-DD} - {Feature Name}

**Branch:** {branch-name}
**Plan:** docs/plans/active/{date}-{feature-slug}.md
**Status:** in-progress | blocked | completed

### Progress Today
- [x] Completed task 1
- [ ] Blocked on task 2

### Key Decisions
- Decision: {what we chose and why}

### Issues Found
- Issue: {description} - fixed in commit abc1234

### Next Session
- Start with task X
```

### Completion Rules

**Create ONE completion report when fully done:**

**File format:** `docs/plans/active/{date}-{feature-slug}-COMPLETION.md`

**Required sections:**
```markdown
---
plan: {date}-{feature-slug}.md
completed: YYYY-MM-DD
outcome: success | partial | failed
---

# Completion: Feature Name

## What We Built
- Feature 1: {1 sentence}

## Metrics
- Baseline: X → Current: Y

## What Worked / Didn't Work
...

## Next Actions
- [ ] Monitor X
- [ ] Archive plan
```

**When to create completion report:**
- All tasks in plan are completed OR explicitly deferred
- All tests are passing
- Code is merged to main branch
- Never create partial/interim reports

### Archive Rules

**Archive immediately after completion report:**
```bash
git mv docs/plans/active/{plan}.md docs/plans/archive/2025/10/
git mv docs/plans/active/{plan}-COMPLETION.md docs/plans/archive/2025/10/
```

**Archive structure:** `docs/plans/archive/{year}/{month}/`

### Forbidden: Root-Level Documentation

**NEVER create these at repository root:**
- `*_SUMMARY.md`
- `*_REPORT.md`
- `*_FIX.md`
- `*_STATUS.md`
- `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `*.txt` status files

**Exception:** README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, SKILL.md, standard configs

**If you find root-level docs:**
1. Is it a plan? → move to `docs/plans/archive/{year}/{month}/`
2. Investigation notes? → move to `docs/reports/investigations/`
3. Fix summary? → delete (git log has it)
4. Status update? → delete (stale)

### Quick Reference: Where Things Go

| Document Type | Location |
|---------------|----------|
| Active plan | `docs/plans/active/` |
| Implementation todos | TodoWrite tool |
| Daily notes | `docs/work-log.md` |
