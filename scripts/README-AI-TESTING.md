## Testing Methods

### Method 1: Command Line Testing
```bash
# Simple test with formatted output
npx tsx scripts/test-agents-simple.ts

# Comprehensive test with all scenarios
npx tsx scripts/test-ai-agents.ts
```

### Method 2: Visual HTML Interface
```bash
# Start dev server if not running
npm run dev

# Open in browser
http://localhost:3000/test-ai-agents.html
```

### Method 3: Direct API Testing
```typescript
// Example in your code
import { DynamicDefenseAgent } from '@/lib/agents/dynamic-defense-agent'

const agent = new DynamicDefenseAgent()
const testData = {
  loanType: 'new_purchase',
  monthlyIncome: 8000,
  riskTolerance: 'conservative',
  // ... other fields
}

const profile = await agent.analyzeClientProfile(testData)
const strategy = await agent.generateDefenseStrategy(testData, profile)
console.log(strategy)
```

## Test Scenarios Included

### 1. First-Time HDB Buyer (Urgent)
- Conservative profile
- OTP expiring this month
- Tests urgency detection and stability recommendations

### 2. High Net Worth Refinancing
- Aggressive investor profile
- Lock-in ending soon
- Tests rate optimization strategies

### 3. BTO Application (Planning)
- Moderate risk profile
- 3-6 month timeline
- Tests planning phase recommendations

### 4. Commercial Property
- Business owner profile
- Tests commercial routing to broker

### 5. Competitor Detection
- Tests protection mechanisms
- Information gating demonstration

## Sample Outputs

### Client Profile Analysis
```
Risk Profile: conservative
Financial Strength: moderate
Sophistication: medium
Urgency: immediate
Priorities: [stability, certainty, long-term planning]
```

### Defense Strategy
```
Primary Strategy: Fixed Rate Security Strategy
Description: Lock in certainty with competitive fixed rates
Advantages:
  ‚Ä¢ Complete payment certainty
  ‚Ä¢ Protection from rate increases
  ‚Ä¢ Simplified budgeting

Risk Mitigation:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è OTP Expiry Risk (HIGH)
  ‚Üí Apply to multiple banks simultaneously
```

### Multi-Layer Strategy
```
Immediate Actions:
  ‚Ä¢ Secure pre-approval from preferred banks
  ‚Ä¢ Lock in rate indications where possible

Short-term (30 days):
  ‚Ä¢ Execute primary strategy within 30 days
  ‚Ä¢ Monitor market for optimization opportunities

Long-term:
  ‚Ä¢ Build relationship for future refinancing
  ‚Ä¢ Plan prepayment strategy for interest savings
```

### Competitive Protection
```
Normal User: ‚úÖ LEGITIMATE
  - Full access to insights
  - Complete rate intelligence
  - Defense strategies enabled

Competitor Detected: üö® RESTRICTED
  - Generic information only
  - Rate details hidden
  - Session monitored
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Intelligent Profiling**: Automatically assesses client sophistication and risk appetite
2. **Contextual Strategies**: Different approaches for conservative vs aggressive profiles
3. **Urgency-Based Actions**: Prioritizes actions based on timeline (OTP, lock-in, etc.)
4. **Security**: Protects sensitive information from competitors
5. **Broker Integration**: Prepares consultation briefs for smooth handoff

## Customization

To test with your own data, modify the test scenarios in:
- `scripts/test-agents-simple.ts` - For quick testing
- `scripts/test-ai-agents.ts` - For comprehensive testing
- `public/test-ai-agents.html` - For visual testing

## Validation Checklist

‚úÖ **Client Profile Detection**
- [ ] Risk profile matches input preferences
- [ ] Financial strength calculated correctly
- [ ] Urgency level appropriate for timeline

‚úÖ **Strategy Generation**
- [ ] Primary strategy aligns with profile
- [ ] Alternatives provided for flexibility
- [ ] Risk mitigation addresses key concerns

‚úÖ **Broker Preparation**
- [ ] Consultation brief includes key points
- [ ] Expected questions are relevant
- [ ] Closing strategy matches urgency

‚úÖ **Protection Mechanisms**
- [ ] Competitors detected accurately
- [ ] Information properly gated
- [ ] Session monitoring active

## Troubleshooting

If agents return undefined or errors:
1. Check that all required fields are provided
2. Verify enum values match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure monthlyIncome is a number, not string
4. Check TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Next Steps

After testing, integrate the agents into:
1. `components/forms/IntelligentMortgageForm.tsx`
2. `components/forms/SimpleAgentUI.tsx`
3. `app/api/forms/analyze/route.ts`

Remove n8n dependencies and use local agent processing as demonstrated in the tests.
