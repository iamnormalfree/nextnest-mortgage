## Computational Precision Rules

### Client Protection Rounding Standards

**Loan Eligibility (ROUND DOWN to nearest $1,000)**
- Purpose: Protect clients from over-borrowing
- Applies to: max_loan_amount, tdsr_limit, msr_limit, ltv_loan_amount
- Formula: `Math.floor(value / 1000) * 1000`

**Funds Required (ROUND UP to nearest $1,000)**
- Purpose: Ensure clients have sufficient funds
- Applies to: pledge_fund, show_fund, downpayment, stamp_duty, cpf_refund
- Formula: `Math.ceil(value / 1000) * 1000`

**Monthly Payments (ROUND UP to nearest $1)**
- Purpose: Conservative payment estimation
- Applies to: monthly_installment, tdsr_commitment, msr_payment
- Formula: `Math.ceil(value)`

**Percentages (2 decimal places)**
- Applies to: interest_rates, absd_rates, roi_percentages
- Formula: `Math.round(value * 100) / 100`

---

## Core Formulas

### 1. Monthly Mortgage Payment

**Standard Formula:**
```
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```

Where:
- **P** = Principal loan amount
- **r** = Monthly interest rate (annual_rate / 12)
- **n** = Total number of payments (years × 12)

**Exact Calculation:**
```javascript
loanAmount * (monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, numberOfPayments)) /
  (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, numberOfPayments) - 1)
```

**Client Display:** `Math.ceil(exact_calculation)`

**Edge Cases:**
- Zero interest: `P / n`
- Variable rates: Use weighted average of rates across tenure

---

### 2. Maximum Loan from Monthly Payment (Inverse Formula)

**Formula:**
```
P = M × [(1+r)^n - 1] / [r(1+r)^n]
```

Where:
- **M** = Monthly payment amount
- **r** = Monthly interest rate
- **n** = Total number of payments

**Exact Calculation:**
```javascript
monthlyPayment * (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, numberOfPayments) - 1) /
  (monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, numberOfPayments))
```

**Client Display:** `Math.floor(exact_calculation / 1000) * 1000`
**Note:** Round DOWN to nearest thousand for loan eligibility

---

### 3. TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio)

**Available Amount Formula:**
```
Available = (Recognized_Income × 0.55) - Total_Commitments
```

**Exact Calculation:**
```javascript
(income * 0.55) - commitments
```

**Client Display:** `Math.floor(exact_calculation)`

**Stress Test Rates:**
- Residential properties: **4.0%**
- Commercial properties: **5.0%**
- **Rule:** Use higher of stress test rate or actual rate

---

### 4. MSR (Mortgage Servicing Ratio)

**Formula:**
```
MSR_Limit = Recognized_Income × 0.30
```

**Exact Calculation:**
```javascript
income * 0.30
```

**Client Display:** `Math.floor(exact_calculation)`

**Applies to:** HDB and EC (Executive Condominium) properties only

**Important:** MSR is in addition to TDSR. Use whichever is more restrictive.

---

### 5. IWAA (Income-Weighted Average Age)

**Formula:**
```
IWAA = (Age1 × Income1 + Age2 × Income2 + ...) / (Income1 + Income2 + ...)
```

**Rounding:** Round UP to nearest integer

**Purpose:** Used for determining maximum loan tenure based on retirement age

---

### 6. CPF Accrued Interest

**Compound Interest Formula:**
```
Accrued Interest = Principal × (1 + rate/12)^months - Principal
```

**Annuity Formula (for monthly withdrawals):**
```
Accrued = PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] - (PMT × n)
```

**Parameters:**
- Rate: CPF OA interest rate (currently **2.5%**)
- Compounding: Monthly

---

### 7. Outstanding Loan Balance

**Formula:**
```
Balance = P × [(1+r)^n - (1+r)^p] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```

Where:
- **P** = Original principal
- **r** = Monthly rate
- **n** = Total payments
- **p** = Payments made

---

## Income Recognition Rules

- **Documentation:** Latest 3 months payslips and employment letter

### Variable Income (70% Recognition, Configurable)

---

## Commitment Calculations

### Credit Cards
```
Monthly Commitment = MAX(Outstanding_Balance × 3%, $50)
```
Per card minimum commitment

### Overdraft Facilities
```
Monthly Commitment = Facility_Limit × 5%
```
Based on facility limit, not usage

### Guarantor Obligations
```
Monthly Commitment = Guaranteed_Amount × 20%
```
20% of guaranteed loan amount

### Existing Mortgages
```
Monthly Commitment = Actual payment at stress test rate
```
Stress test: Same as new loan (4% residential, 5% commercial)

```
Maximum 25 years, or until age 65, whichever is lower

**Private Properties:**

```
Maximum 35 years, or until age 75, whichever is lower

## Usage Guidelines for AI Agents

When invoking Dr. Elena for calculations:

1. **Always apply client protection rounding** - Don't round arbitrarily
2. **Use stress test rates** for TDSR/MSR calculations (4% residential, 5% commercial)
3. **Check property type** - MSR only for HDB/EC
4. **Consider age constraints** - Tenure limits differ by property type
5. **Apply correct LTV** - Based on property count and buyer profile
6. **Calculate all stamp duties** - BSD, ABSD, and SSD if applicable
7. **Validate inputs** - Use the validation rules table
8. **Document assumptions** - State which rates, recognition percentages used

---

## Communication Style

Dr. Elena communicates with:
- **Precision:** Exact formulas, no approximations
- **Regulatory clarity:** Cites MAS notices and authorities
- **Client protection:** Conservative rounding for client benefit
- **Educational tone:** Explains "why" behind regulations
- **Singapore context:** Uses local terminology (CPF, HDB, TDSR, MSR)
