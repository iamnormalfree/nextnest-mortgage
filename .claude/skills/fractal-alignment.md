# Fractal Alignment Skill

**Purpose:** Enforce the fractal double-entry alignment system for all code changes.

**When to use:** Before, during, and after any code/plan/runbook modification to ensure alignment across all tiers (Code ‚Üí Runbooks ‚Üí Plans ‚Üí Roadmap ‚Üí Re-Strategy).

---

## System Overview

You are enforcing a **fractal double-entry system** where every change:
1. **References tier above** (upward alignment to strategy)
2. **Has evidence below** (downward verification with tests/metrics)
3. **Serves active constraint** (Theory of Constraints - single bottleneck)
4. **Creates audit trail** (work log documentation)

**Tiers:**
- **Tier 5:** Re-strategy parts (`docs/plans/re-strategy/Part*.md`)
- **Tier 4:** Roadmap constraints (`docs/plans/ROADMAP.md`)
- **Tier 3:** Active plans (`docs/plans/active/*.md`)
- **Tier 2:** Runbooks (`docs/runbooks/**/*.md`)
- **Tier 1:** Code (`CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md` files)
- **Tier 0:** Tests (`tests/**/*.test.ts`)

---

## Phase 1: CHECK Operation (Pre-Implementation)

### Step 1.1: Load Context

**Read these files in order:**

```bash
# Strategy layer
docs/plans/re-strategy/strategy-alignment-matrix.md
docs/plans/ROADMAP.md
docs/plans/re-strategy/backlog/master-task-list.csv

# Tracking layer
docs/work-log.md (last 200 lines)
docs/reports/strategy-alignment-inventory.md

# Governance
CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md
```

### Step 1.2: Identify Change Tier

Analyze user request and determine tier:

- Mentions "test" or "spec" ‚Üí **Tier 0**
- Mentions file in `lib/`, `components/`, `app/` ‚Üí **Tier 1**
- Mentions "runbook" or "guide" ‚Üí **Tier 2**
- Mentions "plan" ‚Üí **Tier 3**
- Mentions "roadmap" or "constraint" ‚Üí **Tier 4**
- Mentions "re-strategy" or "Part 0X" ‚Üí **Tier 5**

**Output:** "Target tier: Tier [0-5]"

### Step 1.3: Verify Active Constraint

**From strategy-alignment-matrix.md:**

```bash
# Find the constraint with üü° status
grep "üü°" docs/plans/re-strategy/strategy-alignment-matrix.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is there exactly ONE constraint with üü°? (If multiple: RED FLAG)
2. What is the active constraint? (A, B, C, or D)
3. Does user request serve this constraint?

**Output:** "Active constraint: Constraint [A/B/C/D]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If user request targets different constraint ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ùå ALIGNMENT BLOCK: User request targets Constraint [X], but active constraint is [Y].

Per Theory of Constraints, we focus on single bottleneck at a time.

Options:
1. Defer this work until Constraint [Y] complete
2. Re-scope to serve Constraint [Y]
3. Discuss with Brent if truly urgent

Cannot proceed without resolution.
```

### Step 1.4: Check CAN Task Exists

**Search master-task-list.csv:**

```bash
grep -i "keywords from user request" docs/plans/re-strategy/backlog/master-task-list.csv
```

**Questions:**
1. Does a CAN task exist for this work?
2. If yes: What's the CAN-### ID?
3. What's the status? (Planned/In Progress/Completed)
4. Is there an owner assigned?

**Output:** "CAN task: CAN-[###] - [Description] (Status: [X])"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If no CAN task exists and work is non-trivial ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è NO CAN TASK: This work has no CAN task in the backlog.

This could indicate:
1. Work is not aligned with re-strategy
2. CAN task should be created
3. Work is exploratory (document in work log)

Request user confirmation:
- Should I create a CAN task for this? (Provide CAN-XXX number + description)
- Is this exploratory work? (Will log as experiment)
- Should we discuss with Brent first?
```

### Step 1.5: Check Runbook Prerequisite

**If tier is 1 or 0 (code/tests), verify runbook exists:**

```bash
# Search for relevant runbook
ls docs/runbooks/**/*.md | grep -i "topic keywords"
```

**Questions:**
1. Does a runbook exist for this implementation?
2. If yes: What's the file path?
3. If no: Is there a CAN task to create it?

**Output:** "Runbook: [path] or [CAN-### to create]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If runbook missing and no CAN task ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
üö´ MISSING RUNBOOK: Code implementation requires Tier 2 runbook first.

Per fractal alignment: Tier 2 (runbook) must exist before Tier 1 (code).

Options:
1. Create runbook now (extract patterns from similar code)
2. Add CAN task to backlog for runbook creation
3. Reference existing runbook if applicable

Cannot implement code before implementation guide exists.
```

### Step 1.6: Check Tier 1 Rules

**If modifying canonical files:**

```bash
grep "filename" CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is this a Tier 1 (canonical) file?
2. What are the change rules?
3. Are there test requirements?
4. Are there review requirements?

**Output:** "Tier 1 rules: [rules from CANONICAL_REFERENCES]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If Tier 1 rules exist ‚Üí Must follow them (note in verification phase)

### Step 1.7: Check for Conflicts

**Search work log and active plans:**

```bash
# Recent work on same files/features
grep -i "keywords" docs/work-log.md
grep -i "keywords" docs/plans/active/*.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is there recent work on this area? (last 2 weeks)
2. Is there an active plan already covering this?
3. Are there blockers noted in work log?

**Output:** "Conflicts: [none | describe conflict]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If active plan already exists ‚Üí Should update existing plan, not create new one

### Step 1.8: CHECK Phase Summary

**Create checkpoint report:**

```markdown
## Pre-Implementation Checkpoint - [Feature Name]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**User Request:** [summarize]

### Alignment Verification
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Target tier: Tier [0-5]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Active constraint: Constraint [A/B/C/D]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Request serves active constraint: [yes/no]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå CAN task: CAN-[###] or [reason if none]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Runbook: [path] or [CAN-### to create]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Tier 1 rules: [rules or N/A]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå No conflicts: [none or describe]

### Decision
[‚úÖ PROCEED | ‚ùå BLOCKED - resolve issues above]

### Next Steps (if PROCEED)
1. [Implementation steps]
2. [Verification steps]
3. [Evidence to collect]
```

**If ANY check failed ‚Üí STOP. Present checkpoint report to user. Do not proceed to implementation.**

**If ALL checks passed ‚Üí Present checkpoint report and proceed to Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 2: IMPLEMENT Operation (During)

### Step 2.1: Follow TDD Cycle

**MANDATORY: Write test first (CLAUDE.md TDD rules)**

1. Write failing test
2. Run test to confirm failure
3. Implement ONLY enough to pass test
4. Run test to confirm success
5. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Reference runbook:** During implementation, consult runbook for patterns (don't guess).

### Step 2.2: Create Tier References

**While implementing, create references:**

**If writing code (Tier 1):**
```typescript
// In component file:
// Implementation follows: docs/runbooks/forms/mobile-optimization-guide.md
// Serves: Constraint A, CAN-051 (mobile forms)
```

**If creating runbook (Tier 2):**
```markdown
## Constraint Alignment
This runbook supports Constraint A (Public Surface Readiness).
References: Part 04 Brand & UX Canon
Related CAN tasks: CAN-051
```

**If updating plan (Tier 3):**
```markdown
## Constraint Alignment
**Constraint:** Constraint A ‚Äì Public Surface Readiness
**CAN Tasks:** CAN-051, CAN-037
**Re-Strategy References:** Part 02 (Stage 0 gate), Part 04 (Brand canon)
```

### Step 2.3: Track Progress with TodoWrite

**Create paired todos:**

```javascript
[
  // Entry 1: The work
  {content: "Implement [feature] per runbook", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Implementing"},

  // Entry 2: The verification
  {content: "Verify [feature] meets exit criteria", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying"}
]
```

**Mark completed IMMEDIATELY** after each todo finishes.

### Step 2.4: Log in Work Log

**Add entry to docs/work-log.md:**

```markdown
## [Feature Name] - In Progress

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Constraint:** Constraint [A/B/C/D]
**CAN Task:** CAN-[###]
**Tier:** [0-5]

### Implementation Notes
- Files modified: [list]
- Runbook referenced: [path]
- Tests added/updated: [list]
- Next: [what's remaining]
```

---

## Phase 3: VERIFY Operation (Post-Implementation)

### Step 3.1: Collect Evidence

**Based on tier, collect appropriate evidence:**

**Tier 0/1 (Tests/Code):**
- Run tests: `npm test [relevant suite]`
- Save output to: `validation-reports/test-results-[feature]-[date].txt`
- Check coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`

**Tier 1 (Code):**
- Take screenshots (if UI change): `validation-reports/screenshots/[feature]-[date].png`
- Run Lighthouse (if public surface): `validation-reports/lighthouse-[date].json`
- Check bundle size: `npm run build` output

**Tier 2 (Runbook):**
- Verify code examples work (test them)
- Check runbook referenced in code comments

**Tier 3 (Plan):**
- Verify all task checkboxes marked
- Verify success criteria met
- Create completion report if plan fully done

### Step 3.2: Verify Success Criteria

**From the tier above, check success criteria:**

**If Tier 0/1 ‚Üí Check Plan (Tier 3):**
```bash
# Open relevant plan
code docs/plans/active/[plan-name].md

# Check "Success Criteria" section
# Verify each criterion met
```

**If Tier 2 ‚Üí Check Roadmap (Tier 4):**
```bash
# Open roadmap
code docs/plans/ROADMAP.md

# Check constraint exit criteria
# Verify this runbook contributes to exit
```

**If Tier 3 ‚Üí Check Matrix (Tier 4):**
```bash
# Open matrix
code docs/plans/re-strategy/strategy-alignment-matrix.md

# Check constraint row
# Verify this plan listed in "Active Plans" column
```

### Step 3.3: Update Tier Above

**Propagate status update:**

**If code complete ‚Üí Update plan:**
- Mark task checkbox: `- [x] Implement feature X`
- Add evidence link: `Evidence: validation-reports/...`

**If plan complete ‚Üí Update constraint:**
- Move plan to archive: `docs/plans/archive/[year]/[month]/`
- Update matrix constraint status (if all plans done)

**If constraint complete ‚Üí Update roadmap:**
- Change emoji: üü° ‚Üí ‚úÖ
- Document exit criteria satisfaction

### Step 3.4: Link Evidence

**In Stage 0 gate (if Constraint A):**

```markdown
- [x] Form accessibility verified
  - Evidence: validation-reports/accessibility-scan-2025-10-31.pdf
  - Tests: tests/a11y/form-accessibility.test.ts (passing)
  - Date: 2025-10-31
```

**In plan completion report:**

```markdown
## Evidence Archive
- Test results: validation-reports/test-results-mobile-forms-2025-10-31.txt
- Screenshots: validation-reports/screenshots/mobile-forms-*.png
- Lighthouse: validation-reports/lighthouse-2025-10-31.json
```

### Step 3.5: Update Work Log

**Add completion entry:**

```markdown
## [Feature Name] - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Constraint:** Constraint [A/B/C/D]
**CAN Task:** CAN-[###] (Completed)
**Tier:** [0-5]

### Summary
- Implemented: [what was built]
- Tests: [X/X passing]
- Evidence: [links to validation reports]

### Tier References
- ‚Üë Serves: [plan/constraint/re-strategy reference]
- ‚Üì Verified by: [tests/evidence files]

### Next Steps
- [Follow-up work if any]
```

---

## Phase 4: RECONCILE Operation (Periodic)

**This phase runs during weekly constraint review.**

### Step 4.1: Verify Tier Balance

**For each constraint in matrix:**

```bash
# Check bidirectional references
1. Does constraint reference re-strategy part? (‚Üë upward)
2. Do plans reference constraint? (‚Üì downward)
3. Do runbooks exist for plans? (‚Üì downward)
4. Does code follow runbooks? (‚Üì downward)
5. Do tests verify code? (‚Üì downward)
6. Is evidence linked? (‚Üì downward)
```

**If ANY link broken ‚Üí Flag drift for remediation.**

### Step 4.2: Detect Drift Patterns

**Red flags:**

üö© **Multiple constraints üü°:** Violates Theory of Constraints
üö© **Plan references future constraint:** Premature work
üö© **Code without runbook:** Tier skipping
üö© **Status ‚úÖ without evidence:** Unverified claim
üö© **CAN task "In Progress" >2 weeks:** Likely blocked

**For each red flag ‚Üí Create remediation task.**

### Step 4.3: Update Matrix

**After reconciliation:**

```bash
# Update strategy-alignment-matrix.md
# Change status emojis based on evidence
# Add notes for any status changes
```
