# Fractal Alignment Skill

**Purpose:** Enforce the fractal double-entry alignment system for all code changes.

**When to use:** Before, during, and after any code/plan/runbook modification to ensure alignment across all tiers (Code ‚Üí Runbooks ‚Üí Plans ‚Üí Roadmap ‚Üí Re-Strategy).

---

## System Overview

You are enforcing a **fractal double-entry system** where every change:
1. **References tier above** (upward alignment to strategy)
2. **Has evidence below** (downward verification with tests/metrics)
3. **Serves active constraint** (Theory of Constraints - single bottleneck)
4. **Creates audit trail** (work log documentation)

**Tiers:**
- **Tier 6:** Meta-tier (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`)
- **Tier 5:** Re-strategy parts (`docs/plans/re-strategy/Part*.md`)
- **Tier 4:** Roadmap constraints (`docs/plans/ROADMAP.md`)
- **Tier 3:** Active plans (`docs/plans/active/*.md`)
- **Tier 2:** Runbooks (`docs/runbooks/**/*.md`)
- **Tier 1:** Code (`CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md` files)
- **Tier 0:** Tests (`tests/**/*.test.ts`)

---

## Phase 1: CHECK Operation (Pre-Implementation)

### Step 1.1: Load Context

**Read these files in order:**

```bash
# Strategy layer
docs/plans/re-strategy/strategy-alignment-matrix.md
docs/plans/ROADMAP.md
docs/plans/re-strategy/backlog/master-task-list.csv

# Tracking layer
docs/work-log.md (last 200 lines)
docs/reports/strategy-alignment-inventory.md

# Governance
CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md
```

### Step 1.2: Identify Change Tier

Analyze user request and determine tier:

- Mentions "CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md", "slash command", ".claude/skills/", ".claude/commands/" ‚Üí **Tier 6**
- Mentions "test" or "spec" ‚Üí **Tier 0**
- Mentions file in `lib/`, `components/`, `app/` ‚Üí **Tier 1**
- Mentions "runbook" or "guide" ‚Üí **Tier 2**
- Mentions "plan" ‚Üí **Tier 3**
- Mentions "roadmap" or "constraint" ‚Üí **Tier 4**
- Mentions "re-strategy" or "Part 0X" ‚Üí **Tier 5**

**Output:** "Target tier: Tier [0-6]"

### Step 1.3: Verify Active Constraint

**From strategy-alignment-matrix.md:**

```bash
# Find the constraint with üü° status
grep "üü°" docs/plans/re-strategy/strategy-alignment-matrix.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is there exactly ONE constraint with üü°? (If multiple: RED FLAG)
2. What is the active constraint? (A, B, C, or D)
3. Does user request serve this constraint?

**Output:** "Active constraint: Constraint [A/B/C/D]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If user request targets different constraint ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ùå ALIGNMENT BLOCK: User request targets Constraint [X], but active constraint is [Y].

Per Theory of Constraints, we focus on single bottleneck at a time.

Options:
1. Defer this work until Constraint [Y] complete
2. Re-scope to serve Constraint [Y]
3. Discuss with Brent if truly urgent

Cannot proceed without resolution.
```

### Step 1.4: Check CAN Task Exists

**Search master-task-list.csv:**

```bash
grep -i "keywords from user request" docs/plans/re-strategy/backlog/master-task-list.csv
```

**Questions:**
1. Does a CAN task exist for this work?
2. If yes: What's the CAN-### ID?
3. What's the status? (Planned/In Progress/Completed)
4. Is there an owner assigned?

**Output:** "CAN task: CAN-[###] - [Description] (Status: [X])"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If no CAN task exists and work is non-trivial ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è NO CAN TASK: This work has no CAN task in the backlog.

This could indicate:
1. Work is not aligned with re-strategy
2. CAN task should be created
3. Work is exploratory (document in work log)

Request user confirmation:
- Should I create a CAN task for this? (Provide CAN-XXX number + description)
- Is this exploratory work? (Will log as experiment)
- Should we discuss with Brent first?
```

### Step 1.5: Check Runbook Prerequisite

**If tier is 1 or 0 (code/tests), verify runbook exists:**

```bash
# Search for relevant runbook
ls docs/runbooks/**/*.md | grep -i "topic keywords"
```

**Questions:**
1. Does a runbook exist for this implementation?
2. If yes: What's the file path?
3. If no: Is there a CAN task to create it?

**Output:** "Runbook: [path] or [CAN-### to create]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If runbook missing and no CAN task ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
üö´ MISSING RUNBOOK: Code implementation requires Tier 2 runbook first.

Per fractal alignment: Tier 2 (runbook) must exist before Tier 1 (code).

Options:
1. Create runbook now (extract patterns from similar code)
2. Add CAN task to backlog for runbook creation
3. Reference existing runbook if applicable

Cannot implement code before implementation guide exists.
```

### Step 1.6: Check Tier 1 Rules

**If modifying canonical files:**

```bash
grep "filename" CANONICAL_REFERENCES.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is this a Tier 1 (canonical) file?
2. What are the change rules?
3. Are there test requirements?
4. Are there review requirements?

**Output:** "Tier 1 rules: [rules from CANONICAL_REFERENCES]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If Tier 1 rules exist ‚Üí Must follow them (note in verification phase)

---

### Step 1.6a: Meta-Tier Checks (TIER 6 ONLY)

**If user request modifies Tier 6 (meta-tier), run these checks:**

#### Check 1: Slash Command ‚Üî CLAUDE.md Alignment

**If creating/modifying `.claude/commands/*.md`:**

```bash
# Extract command name from filename
command_name=$(basename [file] .md)

# Check if CLAUDE.md references this command
grep -i "$command_name" CLAUDE.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Does CLAUDE.md reference this slash command?
2. Is the command documented in "Quick Commands" or "Tools & Resources" section?
3. Is usage example provided?

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If slash command exists but CLAUDE.md doesn't reference it ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ùå META-TIER BLOCK: Slash command created without CLAUDE.md reference

Command: /[command-name]
File: .claude/commands/[command-name].md

Per Tier 6 alignment: Meta-tier docs must reference each other bidirectionally.

Action required:
1. Add command to CLAUDE.md "Quick Commands (Daily Workflow)" section
2. Include usage example
3. Update "Tools & Resources" section

Books must balance: Commands ‚Üî CLAUDE.md ‚Üî Runbooks

Cannot proceed until CLAUDE.md updated.
```

---

#### Check 2: Skill ‚Üî CLAUDE.md Alignment

**If creating/modifying `.claude/skills/*.md`:**

```bash
# Extract skill name from filename
skill_name=$(basename [file] .md)

# Check if CLAUDE.md references this skill
grep -i "$skill_name" CLAUDE.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Does CLAUDE.md mention this skill?
2. Is it listed in "Tools & Resources" ‚Üí "Skill (Automatic Enforcement)"?
3. Is the skill's purpose explained?

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If skill exists but CLAUDE.md doesn't reference it ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ùå META-TIER BLOCK: Skill created without CLAUDE.md reference

Skill: [skill-name]
File: .claude/skills/[skill-name].md

Per Tier 6 alignment: Skills must be discoverable through CLAUDE.md.

Action required:
1. Add skill to CLAUDE.md "Tools & Resources" ‚Üí "Skill" section
2. Explain when skill is invoked
3. Document what skill enforces

Cannot proceed until CLAUDE.md updated.
```

---

#### Check 3: CLAUDE.md ‚Üî Runbook/Command/Skill Alignment

**If modifying `CLAUDE.md`:**

```bash
# Extract all references to commands, skills, runbooks from changes
# Verify each reference points to existing file
```

**Questions:**
1. Does CLAUDE.md reference commands that exist?
2. Does CLAUDE.md reference skills that exist?
3. Does CLAUDE.md reference runbooks that exist?
4. Are all referenced paths correct?

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If CLAUDE.md references non-existent file ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ùå META-TIER BLOCK: CLAUDE.md references non-existent file

Referenced: [file-path]
In section: [section-name]

Per Tier 6 alignment: References must point to real files.

Action required:
1. Create the referenced file, OR
2. Remove the reference from CLAUDE.md, OR
3. Fix the path to point to correct file

Cannot proceed until references are valid.
```

---

#### Check 4: Runbook ‚Üî CLAUDE.md Alignment

**If creating runbook in `docs/runbooks/strategy/`:**

```bash
# Check if CLAUDE.md references this runbook
runbook_name=$(basename [file])
grep -i "$runbook_name" CLAUDE.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is this a core workflow runbook?
2. Does CLAUDE.md link to it in "Tools & Resources"?
3. Is it mentioned in mandatory workflow section?

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If core strategy runbook created but CLAUDE.md doesn't reference it ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  META-TIER WARNING: Core runbook not referenced in CLAUDE.md

Runbook: docs/runbooks/strategy/[runbook-name]

Core strategy runbooks should be discoverable through CLAUDE.md.

Recommendation:
1. Add to CLAUDE.md "Tools & Resources" ‚Üí "Runbooks" section
2. Explain when to use this runbook
3. Link from relevant workflow section

You can proceed, but consider adding reference for discoverability.
```

---

#### Check 5: Self-Consistency Check

**If modifying ANY Tier 6 file, verify it follows its own rules:**

```bash
# For skills: Does the skill enforce what it describes?
# For CLAUDE.md: Does it follow its own documented workflow?
# For commands: Do they implement what they promise?
```

**Questions:**
1. If this is a workflow doc, does it follow the workflow it describes?
2. If this is CLAUDE.md and it says "run /check-alignment", did WE run it?
3. Does this change demonstrate the pattern it teaches?

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If meta-tier doc violates its own rules ‚Üí STOP and say:
```
‚ùå META-TIER BLOCK: Self-consistency violation

The change violates the principles it documents.

Example:
- CLAUDE.md says "run /check-alignment before coding"
- But we modified CLAUDE.md without running /check-alignment
- This is hypocritical (do as I say, not as I do)

Action required:
1. Apply the documented workflow to this change
2. Demonstrate the pattern being taught
3. "Eat your own dog food"

Cannot proceed until self-consistent.
```

---

### Step 1.7: Check for Conflicts

**Search work log and active plans:**

```bash
# Recent work on same files/features
grep -i "keywords" docs/work-log.md
grep -i "keywords" docs/plans/active/*.md
```

**Questions:**
1. Is there recent work on this area? (last 2 weeks)
2. Is there an active plan already covering this?
3. Are there blockers noted in work log?

**Output:** "Conflicts: [none | describe conflict]"

**BLOCKING CHECK:** If active plan already exists ‚Üí Should update existing plan, not create new one

### Step 1.8: CHECK Phase Summary

**Create checkpoint report:**

```markdown
## Pre-Implementation Checkpoint - [Feature Name]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**User Request:** [summarize]

### Alignment Verification
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Target tier: Tier [0-6]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Active constraint: Constraint [A/B/C/D]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Request serves active constraint: [yes/no]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå CAN task: CAN-[###] or [reason if none]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Runbook: [path] or [CAN-### to create]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Tier 1 rules: [rules or N/A]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Meta-tier alignment: [N/A or checks passed]
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå No conflicts: [none or describe]

### Decision
[‚úÖ PROCEED | ‚ùå BLOCKED - resolve issues above]

### Next Steps (if PROCEED)
1. [Implementation steps]
2. [Verification steps]
3. [Evidence to collect]
```

**If ANY check failed ‚Üí STOP. Present checkpoint report to user. Do not proceed to implementation.**

**If ALL checks passed ‚Üí Present checkpoint report and proceed to Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 2: IMPLEMENT Operation (During)

### Step 2.1: Follow TDD Cycle

**MANDATORY: Write test first (CLAUDE.md TDD rules)**

1. Write failing test
2. Run test to confirm failure
3. Implement ONLY enough to pass test
4. Run test to confirm success
5. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Reference runbook:** During implementation, consult runbook for patterns (don't guess).

### Step 2.2: Create Tier References

**While implementing, create references:**

**If writing code (Tier 1):**
```typescript
// In component file:
// Implementation follows: docs/runbooks/forms/mobile-optimization-guide.md
// Serves: Constraint A, CAN-051 (mobile forms)
```

**If creating runbook (Tier 2):**
```markdown
## Constraint Alignment
This runbook supports Constraint A (Public Surface Readiness).
References: Part 04 Brand & UX Canon
Related CAN tasks: CAN-051
```

**If updating plan (Tier 3):**
```markdown
## Constraint Alignment
**Constraint:** Constraint A ‚Äì Public Surface Readiness
**CAN Tasks:** CAN-051, CAN-037
**Re-Strategy References:** Part 02 (Stage 0 gate), Part 04 (Brand canon)
```

### Step 2.3: Track Progress with TodoWrite

**Create paired todos:**

```javascript
[
  // Entry 1: The work
  {content: "Implement [feature] per runbook", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Implementing"},

  // Entry 2: The verification
  {content: "Verify [feature] meets exit criteria", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying"}
]
```

**Mark completed IMMEDIATELY** after each todo finishes.

### Step 2.4: Log in Work Log

**Add entry to docs/work-log.md:**

```markdown
## [Feature Name] - In Progress

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Constraint:** Constraint [A/B/C/D]
**CAN Task:** CAN-[###]
**Tier:** [0-5]

### Implementation Notes
- Files modified: [list]
- Runbook referenced: [path]
- Tests added/updated: [list]
- Next: [what's remaining]
```

---

## Phase 3: VERIFY Operation (Post-Implementation)

### Step 3.1: Collect Evidence

**Based on tier, collect appropriate evidence:**

**Tier 6 (Meta-tier):**
- Verify bidirectional references exist (slash commands ‚Üî CLAUDE.md ‚Üî skills ‚Üî runbooks)
- Check self-consistency (does meta-doc follow its own rules?)
- Test slash commands work: Run command and verify output
- Test skills invoke correctly: Verify skill prompt loads
- Document in work log with "Tier 6" tag

**Tier 0/1 (Tests/Code):**
- Run tests: `npm test [relevant suite]`
- Save output to: `validation-reports/test-results-[feature]-[date].txt`
- Check coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`

**Tier 1 (Code):**
- Take screenshots (if UI change): `validation-reports/screenshots/[feature]-[date].png`
- Run Lighthouse (if public surface): `validation-reports/lighthouse-[date].json`
- Check bundle size: `npm run build` output

**Tier 2 (Runbook):**
- Verify code examples work (test them)
- Check runbook referenced in code comments

**Tier 3 (Plan):**
- Verify all task checkboxes marked
- Verify success criteria met
- Create completion report if plan fully done

### Step 3.2: Verify Success Criteria

**From the tier above, check success criteria:**

**If Tier 6 ‚Üí Check Re-Strategy (Tier 5):**
```bash
# Verify meta-tier changes align with strategic principles
# Check if CLAUDE.md changes support active constraint
# Verify fractal alignment principles maintained
```

**If Tier 0/1 ‚Üí Check Plan (Tier 3):**
```bash
# Open relevant plan
code docs/plans/active/[plan-name].md

# Check "Success Criteria" section
# Verify each criterion met
```

**If Tier 2 ‚Üí Check Roadmap (Tier 4):**
```bash
# Open roadmap
code docs/plans/ROADMAP.md

# Check constraint exit criteria
# Verify this runbook contributes to exit
```

**If Tier 3 ‚Üí Check Matrix (Tier 4):**
```bash
# Open matrix
code docs/plans/re-strategy/strategy-alignment-matrix.md

# Check constraint row
# Verify this plan listed in "Active Plans" column
```

### Step 3.3: Update Tier Above

**Propagate status update:**

**If meta-tier changed ‚Üí Verify self-reference:**
- Ensure CLAUDE.md references updated
- Ensure skills/commands are discoverable
- Document in work log with Tier 6 tag

**If code complete ‚Üí Update plan:**
- Mark task checkbox: `- [x] Implement feature X`
- Add evidence link: `Evidence: validation-reports/...`

**If plan complete ‚Üí Update constraint:**
- Move plan to archive: `docs/plans/archive/[year]/[month]/`
- Update matrix constraint status (if all plans done)

**If constraint complete ‚Üí Update roadmap:**
- Change emoji: üü° ‚Üí ‚úÖ
- Document exit criteria satisfaction

### Step 3.4: Link Evidence

**In Stage 0 gate (if Constraint A):**

```markdown
- [x] Form accessibility verified
  - Evidence: validation-reports/accessibility-scan-2025-10-31.pdf
  - Tests: tests/a11y/form-accessibility.test.ts (passing)
  - Date: 2025-10-31
```

**In plan completion report:**

```markdown
## Evidence Archive
- Test results: validation-reports/test-results-mobile-forms-2025-10-31.txt
- Screenshots: validation-reports/screenshots/mobile-forms-*.png
- Lighthouse: validation-reports/lighthouse-2025-10-31.json
```

### Step 3.5: Update Work Log

**Add completion entry:**

```markdown
## [Feature Name] - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Constraint:** Constraint [A/B/C/D]
**CAN Task:** CAN-[###] (Completed)
**Tier:** [0-5]

### Summary
- Implemented: [what was built]
- Tests: [X/X passing]
- Evidence: [links to validation reports]

### Tier References
- ‚Üë Serves: [plan/constraint/re-strategy reference]
- ‚Üì Verified by: [tests/evidence files]

### Next Steps
- [Follow-up work if any]
```

---

## Phase 4: RECONCILE Operation (Periodic)

**This phase runs during weekly constraint review.**

### Step 4.1: Verify Tier Balance

**For each constraint in matrix:**

```bash
# Check bidirectional references (7 tiers, 0-6)
1. Does CLAUDE.md enforce fractal alignment? (Tier 6 meta-tier)
2. Does constraint reference re-strategy part? (Tier 5 ‚Üí Tier 4 upward)
3. Do plans reference constraint? (Tier 4 ‚Üí Tier 3 downward)
4. Do runbooks exist for plans? (Tier 3 ‚Üí Tier 2 downward)
5. Does code follow runbooks? (Tier 2 ‚Üí Tier 1 downward)
6. Do tests verify code? (Tier 1 ‚Üí Tier 0 downward)
7. Is evidence linked? (Tier 0 evidence)
```

**If ANY link broken ‚Üí Flag drift for remediation.**

### Step 4.2: Detect Drift Patterns

**Red flags:**

üö© **Multiple constraints üü°:** Violates Theory of Constraints
üö© **Plan references future constraint:** Premature work
üö© **Code without runbook:** Tier skipping
üö© **Status ‚úÖ without evidence:** Unverified claim
üö© **CAN task "In Progress" >2 weeks:** Likely blocked

**For each red flag ‚Üí Create remediation task.**

### Step 4.3: Update Matrix

**After reconciliation:**

```bash
# Update strategy-alignment-matrix.md
# Change status emojis based on evidence
# Add notes for any status changes
```

---

## Output Format

After completing CHECK/IMPLEMENT/VERIFY cycle, provide:

```markdown
## Fractal Alignment Report - [Feature Name]
