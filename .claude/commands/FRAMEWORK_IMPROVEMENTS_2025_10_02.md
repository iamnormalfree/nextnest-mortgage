# Response-Awareness Framework Improvements
## Date: 2025-10-02
## Issue: Orchestrator Implementation Deviation Prevention

---

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: Orchestrators were implementing directly instead of delegating to agents, causing:
- Loss of coordination map (cognitive overload)
- Inability to handle escalations
- Breaking the orchestration model

**Root Cause**: "Just Do It" cognitive trap
- Clear implementation plan → strong momentum to implement immediately
- Feels wasteful to delegate when context is loaded
- No friction/reminder at the critical transition point

---

## Framework Enhancements Added

### 1. Universal Implementation Firewall (All Tiers)

**Location**: `response-awareness.md` (lines 43-66)

**Key Rule**:
> Once you use Task() tool → you are orchestrator → NEVER implement directly

**Self-Check Protocol**:
1. Have I used Task() in this conversation?
   - YES → Orchestrator → MUST delegate
   - NO → Can implement (if tier-appropriate)

2. What tier am I in?
   - LIGHT: Direct OK
   - MEDIUM: Delegate if used Task()
   - HEAVY/FULL: ALWAYS delegate

**Recovery Protocol**:
1. STOP implementing
2. Document as design
3. Deploy agent with design
4. Return to orchestration

---

### 2. Phase Transition Checkpoint (HEAVY Tier)

**Location**: `response-awareness-heavy.md` (lines 281-316)

**Mandatory Stop Before Implementation**:

**Q1**: Do I have clear implementation plan?
- YES → Q2
- NO → Return to synthesis

**Q2**: Am I orchestrator or implementer?
- Orchestrator (used Task()) → MUST delegate
- Implementer (deployed) → Can implement

**Q3**: How many files need changes?
- 1 file → Single agent
- 2-3 files → Parallel agents
- 4+ files → Coordinated agents

**Red Flag**: If typing `Edit()` or `Write()` → YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG

---

### 3. Orchestrator Cognitive Load Checklist (HEAVY Tier)

**Location**: `response-awareness-heavy.md` (lines 355-385)

**What Orchestrators SHOULD Hold**:
- ✅ Architecture map
- ✅ Agent deployment status
- ✅ Integration plan
- ✅ Phase transitions
- ✅ Escalation handling

**What Orchestrators Should NOT Hold**:
- ❌ Implementation details (which line)
- ❌ Function logic (how to code)
- ❌ Code syntax (Edit parameters)

**Cognitive Self-Check**:
- Thinking "which line to edit" → ❌ Lost orchestrator role
- Thinking "how to implement function" → ❌ Deploy agent
- Thinking "what next file change" → ✅ Still orchestrator
- Thinking "how agents integrate" → ✅ Orchestrator job
- Thinking "when to verify" → ✅ Orchestrator job

---

### 4. Implementation Firewall (HEAVY Tier)

**Location**: `response-awareness-heavy.md` (lines 320-351)

**Stop Before Edit/Write/NotebookEdit**:

**Q1**: Am I orchestrating or implementing?
- Orchestrating → Use Task()
- Implementing → OK if deployed agent

**Q2**: Have I used Task()?
- YES → Orchestrator → NEVER implement
- NO → Can implement (consider delegation)

**Q3**: Last step or more coordination?
- More coordination → Delegate
- Last step only → Can implement

**The "Just Do It" Trap**:
> Clear plan creates momentum to implement quickly
> This LOSES coordination map → breaks escalation handling

---

### 5. MEDIUM Tier Implementation Warning

**Location**: `response-awareness-medium.md` (lines 18-20)

**Rule**:
> If you use Task() for planning/analysis → you are orchestrator → delegate implementation
> Direct implementation only if: (1) No Task() used AND (2) single straightforward change

---

### 6. LIGHT Tier Clarification

**Location**: `response-awareness-light.md` (lines 17-18)

**Note**:
> LIGHT tier typically doesn't need orchestration (direct implementation OK)
> Only deploy agent if verification discovers complexity escalation

---

## Implementation Examples

### ❌ WRONG (Orchestrator Implementing)

```python
# Orchestrator has used Task() for analysis
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Analyze architecture", ...)

# Then later...
Edit(file_path, old_string, new_string)  # ❌ WRONG - Lost orchestrator role
```

### ✅ RIGHT (Orchestrator Delegating)

```python
# Orchestrator has used Task() for analysis
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Analyze architecture", ...)

# Analysis complete, now delegate implementation
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    description="Implement aspect ratio fix",
    prompt="""
    Implement character image aspect ratio preservation:

    Files: dialogue_screen.py, dialogue_box.py
    Changes: See architectural design in LCL context

    Return: Confirmation + test verification
    """
)
```

---

## Why These Changes Work

### 1. **Explicit Friction at Transition Point**
- Mandatory stop-and-check before implementation
- Prevents "smooth transition" into wrong role

### 2. **Clear Role Identification**
- Task() usage = definitive orchestrator marker
- No ambiguity about current role

### 3. **Cognitive Load Awareness**
- Explicit list of what orchestrators should/shouldn't hold
- Self-check prompts for role confusion

### 4. **Multiple Safety Layers**
- Universal firewall (all tiers)
- Tier-specific checkpoints (HEAVY)
- Cognitive load checklist (HEAVY)
- Recovery protocol (if breached)

### 5. **Pattern Recognition**
- Identifies "Just Do It" trap by name
- Explains why it's harmful (destroys coordination)
- Provides concrete signals (thinking about line numbers)

## Testing the Improvements

### Scenario 1: HEAVY Tier Task
**Setup**: Complex multi-file feature requiring architectural planning

**Expected Flow**:
1. Router assesses → HEAVY tier
2. Phase 1: Deploy planning agent(s)
3. Phase 2: Deploy synthesis agent
4. **→ CHECKPOINT: Phase 2→3 transition**
   - Q: Clear plan? YES
   - Q: Orchestrator? YES (used Task())
   - Q: Files? 3 files
   - **ACTION: Deploy 3 parallel implementation agents**
5. Phase 4: Deploy verification agent

**Failure Mode Prevented**: Orchestrator implementing after synthesis

### Scenario 2: MEDIUM Tier with Planning
**Setup**: Multi-file feature with architectural choice

**Expected Flow**:
1. Router assesses → MEDIUM tier
2. Optional planning: Deploy planning agent
3. **→ FIREWALL: Used Task() → Now orchestrator**
4. **ACTION: Deploy implementation agent(s)**
5. Verification

**Failure Mode Prevented**: Planning then implementing directly

### Scenario 3: LIGHT Tier
**Setup**: Simple bug fix

**Expected Flow**:
1. Router assesses → LIGHT tier
2. Direct implementation (no Task() used)
3. Quick verification

**No Prevention Needed**: Appropriate for LIGHT tier to implement directly

## Key Insights from This Issue

### 1. Framework Needs Explicit Transitions
Not enough to document roles - need **forced decision points** at transitions

### 2. Cognitive Momentum is Real
Clear plans create strong "just do it" drive that overrides documented rules

### 3. Task() as Role Marker
Using Task() tool is **definitive signal** of orchestrator role - use this as trigger

### 4. Tier-Appropriate Strictness
- LIGHT: Flexible (can implement)
- MEDIUM: Conditional (delegate if used Task())
- HEAVY/FULL: Strict (always delegate)

### 5. Recovery is Important
Don't just prevent - provide **recovery path** when firewall breached

---

## Future Enhancements to Consider

### 1. Automated Tool Restriction
Could the framework **disable** Edit/Write/NotebookEdit for orchestrators?
- Pro: Impossible to violate
- Con: Might need escape hatch for edge cases

### 2. Agent Handoff Protocol
Formalize how orchestrators pass context to implementation agents
- LCL export format
- Architectural design template
- Verification criteria

### 3. Escalation Signals
Add tags for "complexity exceeds current tier" detection
- Auto-suggest tier escalation
- Preserve work done when escalating

### 4. Visual Role Indicators
In UI/tooling: Show current role visually
- "🎯 ORCHESTRATOR MODE" banner
- Disable implementation tools in orchestrator mode

## Files Modified

1. `.claude/commands/response-awareness.md`
   - Added Universal Implementation Firewall (lines 43-66)

2. `.claude/commands/response-awareness-heavy.md`
   - Added orchestrator role warning (lines 18-21)
   - Added Phase 2→3 Transition Checkpoint (lines 281-316)
   - Added Implementation Firewall (lines 320-351)
   - Added Orchestrator Cognitive Load Checklist (lines 355-385)

3. `.claude/commands/response-awareness-medium.md`
   - Added implementation firewall warning (lines 18-20)

4. `.claude/commands/response-awareness-light.md`
   - Added orchestration clarification (lines 17-18)

---

## Validation

These improvements address the exact issue that occurred:
1. ✅ Orchestrator was doing analysis (used Task())
2. ✅ Had clear architectural plan (synthesis complete)
3. ✅ Started implementing directly (Edit() calls)
4. ❌ Should have deployed implementation agents

**With new framework**:
- Phase 2→3 checkpoint would STOP before implementation
- Implementation firewall would detect Task() usage
- Cognitive load checklist would identify role confusion
- Clear delegation protocol provided

---

## Conclusion

The framework now has **explicit friction** at the critical orchestrator→implementation transition point. This prevents the "Just Do It" cognitive trap while maintaining flexibility for appropriate direct implementation in simpler tiers.

**Key Principle Reinforced**:
> Orchestration is a cognitive role, not a process step. Once you hold the coordination map, you cannot simultaneously hold implementation details without losing the map.
