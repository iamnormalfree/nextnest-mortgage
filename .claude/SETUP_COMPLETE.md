# ✅ Setup Complete: Response-Awareness + NextNest Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** Ready to use

---

## What's Working Now

### You Can Use `/response-awareness` Immediately

The router now loads your NextNest customizations from:
`.claude/skills/response-awareness-shared/NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`

**Try it:**

```bash
# Test with a vague request (should offer brainstorming)
/response-awareness "I'm thinking about adding a dashboard"

# Test with a bug (should offer systematic-debugging)
/response-awareness "Fix the calculator bug"

# Test with uncommitted changes (should offer worktree)
git status  # Make sure you have changes
/response-awareness "Add new chat feature"

# Test with clear requirement (should assess complexity and route)
/response-awareness "Add email validation to signup form"
```

## What Was Created

### Configuration Files
- `.claude/config/response-awareness-config.json` - Feature flags, paths, tier settings
- `.claude/config/logging-config.json` - Verbose logging settings
- `.claude/config/agents-config.json` - Custom agents and overrides

### Shared Module (The Key File)
- `.claude/skills/response-awareness-shared/NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md` - **All NextNest customizations**
  - Configuration loading
  - Phase 0 extensions (worktree, brainstorming, debug)
  - TDD enforcement
  - CANONICAL_REFERENCES checks
  - Component placement validation
  - YAGNI checks
  - Logging/plan path overrides

### Skills
- `.claude/skills/brainstorming.md` - From Superpowers (adapted for NextNest)
- `.claude/skills/systematic-debugging.md` - From Superpowers (adapted for NextNest)

### Agents
- `.claude/agents/worktree-helper.md` - Custom worktree management

### Documentation
- `UPDATE_GUIDE.md` - How to sync after GitHub updates
- `RESPONSE_AWARENESS_SETUP.md` - Architecture overview
- `.claude/INTEGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - How the integration works
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Scripts
- `scripts/compare-upstream.js` - Automated comparison tool (optional)

### Router Integration (Already Done)
- `.claude/commands/response-awareness.md` - **Updated with load command**

---

## How It Works

### When You Run `/response-awareness`

1. **Router loads** `.claude/skills/response-awareness-shared/NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`
2. **Loads configs** from `.claude/config/*.json`
3. **Runs Phase 0 Extensions:**
   - Checks for uncommitted changes → Offers worktree if needed
   - Detects vague language → Offers brainstorming if needed
   - Detects bug keywords → Offers systematic-debugging if needed
4. **Assesses complexity** (0-12 score across 4 dimensions)
5. **Routes to tier** (LIGHT/MEDIUM/HEAVY/FULL)
6. **Tier applies NextNest customizations:**
   - TDD enforcement
   - CANONICAL_REFERENCES checks
   - Component placement validation
   - YAGNI ruthlessness
   - Config-based logging/plan paths

---

## After GitHub Updates

When you pull latest response-awareness from GitHub:

### Option 1: Quick Re-Integration (2 minutes)

Just re-add the load command to the router:

```bash
# Edit router
code .claude/commands/response-awareness.md

# Add after "Core Innovation" line:
---

## Load NextNest Customizations

Read file `.claude/skills/response-awareness-shared/NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`

**Apply Phase 0 Extensions before standard complexity assessment:**
- Extension 0.1: Git worktree check (if uncommitted changes detected)
- Extension 0.2: Brainstorming pre-check (if vague language detected)
- Extension 0.3: Debug task detection (if bug keywords detected)

**Load configurations:**
- `.claude/config/response-awareness-config.json`
- `.claude/config/logging-config.json`
- `.claude/config/agents-config.json`

---

# And update Phase 0:
**FIRST: Run NextNest Extensions** (see NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md loaded above)
...
**THEN: Continue with standard complexity assessment:**
```

**Done!** Your customizations work again.

### Option 2: Full Comparison (if major changes)

If the GitHub update is significant, optionally run comparison:

```bash
# Save current version to upstream-reference for comparison
mkdir -p .claude/upstream-reference/response-awareness-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
cp -r .claude/skills/response-awareness-* .claude/upstream-reference/response-awareness-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/

# Pull updates from GitHub
# (your existing workflow)

# Compare
node scripts/compare-upstream.js $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

---

## Configuration You Can Change

All customizations are config-driven. Edit these anytime:

### Enable/Disable Features

`.claude/config/response-awareness-config.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "verbose_logging": true,        // Set to false to disable logging
    "plan_persistence": true,        // Set to false to disable plan saving
    "worktree_integration": true,    // Set to false to disable worktree offers
    "brainstorming_precheck": true,  // Set to false to disable brainstorming offers
    "learning_mode": true            // Set to false to disable learning summaries
  }
}
```

### Change Logging Level

`.claude/config/logging-config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_level": "verbose",  // Options: "none", "light", "verbose"
  ...
}
```

### Change Model Preferences

`.claude/config/response-awareness-config.json`:

```json
{
  "tier_preferences": {
    "light": {
      "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"  // Fast, cheap
    },
    "heavy": {
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  // Powerful, expensive
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Worktree not offered

**Check:**
```json
// .claude/config/response-awareness-config.json
{
  "features": {
    "worktree_integration": true  // Must be true
  }
}
```

### Issue: Brainstorming not offered

**Check:**
```json
// .claude/config/response-awareness-config.json
{
  "features": {
    "brainstorming_precheck": true  // Must be true
  }
}
```

### Issue: Customizations not applying

**Check that router has the load command:**

```bash
grep "NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS" .claude/commands/response-awareness.md
```

Should show:
```
Read file `.claude/skills/response-awareness-shared/NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`
```

If not found, re-add the load command (see "After GitHub Updates" above).

### Issue: Logs not appearing

**Check:**
```json
// .claude/config/logging-config.json
{
  "default_level": "verbose"  // Not "none"
}
```

## Summary of Superpowers Integration

**Added 2 skills from Superpowers:**
1. **brainstorming** - Refines vague ideas into designs
2. **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause investigation

**Why only 2?**
- These 2 have clear integration points with response-awareness
- Other Superpowers skills either overlap with CLAUDE.md or require more setup
- Can add more later if needed (preserving-tensions, knowledge-lineage, conversation-memory)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test the integration:**
   ```bash
   /response-awareness "I'm thinking about adding a user profile page"
   ```

2. **Review a log:**
   ```bash
   ls docs/completion_drive_logs/
   cat docs/completion_drive_logs/*/LEARNING_SUMMARY.md
   ```

3. **Check a plan:**
   ```bash
   ls docs/plans/active/
   ```

### Later
1. **After GitHub update:** Re-add load command to router
2. **If config needs change:** Edit `.claude/config/*.json`
3. **If new customization needed:** Edit `NEXTNEST_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`
